People use their cell phones to find nearby restaurants and friends in the vicinity, and track their children. Although location-based services have received sparse attention from mobile communication scholars to date, the ability to locate people and things with one?s cell phone is not new. Since the removal of GPS signal degradation in 2000, artists and researchers have been exploring how location-awareness influences mobility, spatiality, and sociability. Besides exploring the historical antecedents of today?s location-based services, this article focuses on the main social issues that emerge when location-aware technologies leave the strict domain of art and research and become part of everyday life: locational privacy, sociability, and spatiality. Finally, this article addresses two main topics that future mobile communication research that focuses on location-awareness should take into consideration: a shift in the meaning of location, and the adoption and appropriation of location-aware technologies in the global south.},

We tested this prediction among children (N = 50) who solved and explained Piagetian conservation tasks. For one set of conservation tasks, all children were allowed to gesture. For a second set of tasks, some children were prohibited from gesturing by wearing a cloth mu . When children were prohibited from gesturing, they expressed more non-present information and less perceptually present information in their explanations than when allowed to gesture. us, gesture production appears to highlight or lend salience to perceptually present information. We argue that gesture helps speakers decide what to attend to and therefore what to say.},

In the age of the Anthropocene, thinking beyond the human has become increasingly vital in both ethical and ecological terms, making the ability to envision less anthropocentric, more object-oriented worldviews both novel and timely.},

  abstract = {Challenging today's ascendant digital aesthetic, this essay retraces one powerful line of French theory which treats film as an art which ``discovers'' significance rather than ``constructs'' meaning. Champions of today's technology find that the digital at last permits complete control over image construction and therefore over ``cinema effects.'' Opposed to this aesthetic which targets the audience, the French aesthetic stemming from Roger Leenhardt and Andr\'e Bazin concerns itself with the world the filmmaker engages. An interplay of presence and absence, as well as of human agency in the non-human environment, characterizes the French aesthetic at each phase of the filmic process: recording, composing and projecting. This article focuses on the central phase, composing, and on the terminological shift from ``image'' to ``shot'' picked up after Bazin by the Nouvelle Vague and passed forward to our own day through Serge Daney. In short, there is a Cahiers du cin\'ema line of thought, applied to questions of editing, which emphasizes the filtering implied in shots and the ellipses implied in their order. Conventional editors, on the other hand, manipulate or juxtapose images (using processes known as ``compositing'' today). The Cahiers line of thought developed in symbiosis with neo-realism and with a spate of post-war essay films of the ``cam\'era-stylo'' sort (Resnais, Franju) wherein editing works to cut away and filter out the inessential so that a mysterious or abstract subject can be felt as beginning to appear. Rivette, Rohmer and Godard have passed this line of thought on to a later generation represented by Philippe Garrel and a still later one for which Arnaud Desplechin stands as a good example.},

It is by recognizing patterns in input data that Artificial Intelligence algorithms create bias and practice racial exclusions thereby inscribing power relations into media. How can we filter information out of data without reinserting racist, sexist, and classist beliefs?},

  abstract = {This paper discusses how computer-based techniques of spatial montage can be used to visualise aspects of migration and social division among a displaced community. It is based on an ongoing collaboration between the author and the anthropologist, Wendy JAMES. The work is based on a substantial archive of ethnographic photographs, audio, cine and video recordings collected by JAMES in the Sudan/Ethiopian borderlands over four decades. Initially recording the way of life of several minority peoples, she was later able to follow their fortunes during the repeated war displacements and separations they suffered from the 1980s onwards. The recordings document work rhythms, dance, song and storytelling, music and other sensory rich performances alongside spoken memories of past events. The research is developing spatial montage techniques to draw comparisons across time, between multiple points of view, and between recordings of events and spoken memories of these events. It is argued that these techniques can be used to facilitate direct engagement with ethnographic recordings, creating multimedia experiences which can flexibly integrate fieldwork data into academic discourse. In so doing it is proposed that these techniques offer new tools to enhance the analysis and understanding of issues relating to migration and social division. URN: urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1002361},

  abstract = {"We all have images that we find unwatchable, whether for ethical, political, or sensory-affective reasons. From news coverage of terror attacks to viral videos of police brutality, and from graphic horror films to incendiary artworks that provoke mass boycotts, many of the images in our media culture strike as beyond the pale of consumption. Yet what does it mean to proclaim a media object "unwatchable": disturbing, revolting, poor, tedious, or literally inaccessible? Appealing to a broad academic and general readership, Unwatchable offers multidisciplinary approaches to the vast array of troubling images that circulate in our global visual culture, from cinema, television, and video games through museums and classrooms to laptops, smart phones, and social media platforms. This anthology assembles 60 original essays by scholars, theorists, critics, archivists, curators, artists, and filmmakers who offer their own responses to the broadly suggestive question: What do you find unwatchable? The diverse answers include iconoclastic artworks that have been hidden from view, dystopian images from the political sphere, horror movies, TV advertisements, classic films, and recent award-winners"--},

This collection of new essays investigates the relationships between the "white cube" and the "black box," focusing mainly on the 1970s, a decade in which film practices and moving images were integrated into museums and art spaces. The authors analyze multiple modalities of presenting the moving image through historical case studies: the anatomy of video art, expanded cinema, artists' films and installations, and the moving image in the public sphere. Exploring examples from the 1930s to the present, these contributions address commercial, spectacular or advertising forms of moving images, artists' performative practices, installations in large museums, exhibitions devoted to projections and festivals of experimental films.},

  abstract = {"We have long since lost our faith in the idea that human beings could achieve human happiness in some future ideal state, a state that Thomas More, writing five centuries ago, tied to a topos, a fixed place, a land, an island, a sovereign state under a wise and benevolent ruler. But while we have lost our faith in utopias of all hues, the human aspiration that made this vision so compelling has not died. Instead it is re-emerging today as a vision focused not on the future but on the past, not on a future-to-be-created but on an abandoned and undead past that we could call retrotopia. The emergence of retrotopia is interwoven with the deepening gulf between power and politics that is a defining feature of our contemporary liquid modern world ? the gulf between the ability to get things done and the capability of deciding what things need to be done, a capability once vested with the territorially sovereign state. This deepening gulf has rendered nation-states unable to deliver on their promises, giving rise to a widespread disenchantment with the idea that the future will improve the human condition and a mistrust in the ability of nation-states to make this happen. True to the utopian spirit, retrotopia derives its stimulus from the urge to rectify the failings of the present human condition - though now by resurrecting the failed and forgotten potentials of the past. Imagined aspects of the past, genuine or putative, serve as the main landmarks today in drawing the road-map to a better world. Having lost all faith in the idea of building an alternative society of the future, many turn instead to the grand ideas of the past, buried but not yet dead. Such is retrotopia, the contours of which are examined by Zygmunt Bauman in this sharp dissection of our contemporary romance with the past"--},

  abstract = {Written as a wake-up call to the field of media studies, The Message is Murder analyses the violence bound up in the everyday functions of digital media. At its core is the concept of 'computational capital' - the idea that capitalism itself is a computer, turning qualities into quantities, and that the rise of digital culture and technologies under capitalism should be seen as an extension of capitalism's bloody logic. Engaging with Borges, Turing, Claude Shannon, Hitchcock and Marx, this book tracks computational capital to reveal the lineages of capitalised power as it has restructured representation, consciousness and survival in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It argues that the global intensification of inequality relies on the discursive, informatic and screen-mediated production of social difference. Ultimately The Message is Murder makes the case for recognising media communications across all platforms - books, films, videos, photographs and even language itself - as technologies of political economy, entangled with the social contexts of a capitalism that is inherently racial, gendered and genocidal. --Publisher's web site.},

  pages = {19},
  abstract = {The field of web archiving is at a turning point. In the early years of web archiving, the single URL has been the dominant unit for preservation and access. Access tools such as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine reflect this notion as they allowed consultation, or browsing, of one URL at a time. In recent years, however, the single URL approach to accessing web archives is being gradually replaced by search interfaces. This paper addresses the theoretical and methodological implications of the transition to search on web archive research. It introduces `search as research' methods, practices already applied in studies of the live web, which can be repurposed and implemented for critically studying archived web data. Such methods open up a variety of analytical practices that were so far precluded by the single URL entry point to the web archive, such as the re-assemblage of existing collections around a theme or an event, the study of archival artefacts and scaling the unit of analysis from the single URL to the full archive, by generating aggregate views and summaries. The paper introduces examples to `search as research' scenarios, which have been developed by the WebART project at the University of Amsterdam and the Centrum Wiskunde \& Informatica, in collaboration with the National Library of the Netherlands. The paper concludes with a discussion of current and potential limitations of `search as research' methods for studying web archives, and the ways with which they can be overcome in the near future.},

In Looking Back One Learns to See: Marcel Proust and Photography is an intellectual adventure that brings to light Proust's visual imagination, his visual metaphors, and his photographic resources and imaginings. The book features over 90 illustrations. Mary Bergstein highlights various kinds of photography: daguerreotypes, stereoscopic cards, cartes-de-visite, postcards, book illustrations, and other photographic mediums. Portraiture, medical photography, spirit photography, architectural photography, Orientalism, ethnographic photography, and fin-de-si\`ecle studies of Botticelli, Leonardo, and Vermeer, are considered in terms of Proust's life and work. The net is cast wide, and each image under discussion has been researched with subtle attention to art, literature, and cultural history. This scholarly study in literature and visual culture will be a delight, too, for general readers who love photography or Proust},

He could see little point in showing the original images in public, such as they were. The Lumiere brothers, on the other hand, realised the moving image's spectacular quality and its power to fascinate; they valued it and set out to exploit it, to great success. Writing in 1896},

  abstract = {New digital forms, particularly computer and video games pose a challenge to the cultural status that film has enjoyed for decades. This challenge provoked an anxiety about new media reflected in a series of films in the 1990s, including               eXistenZ               and               The Matrix               . Hollywood filmmakers have responded to the challenge with a two fold strategy: they have adopted computer-graphic special effects, while maintaining a commitment to linear narrative and transparent representation. Recently, the DVD has led the film industry to explore hybrid forms of representation and even interactivity.                        ,                             Les nouveaux objets num\'eriques, en particulier les jeux vid\'eos et les jeux par ordinateurs, ont remis en cause le statut culturel que le cin\'ema a occup\'e pendant des d\'ecennies. Cette remise en cause a donn\'e lieu \`a une anxi\'et\'e vis-\`a-vis des nouveaux m\'edias, qui se trouve r\'efl\'echie dans une s\'erie de films des ann\'ees 1990, notamment               eXistenZ               et               The Matrix               .

To do this we must go back to one of the greatest theorists of ideology, Althusser, and examine how ideology conditions political discourse in ways that normalize cultural, racial and economic practices of exclusion"--},

For a ""tunnel rat"" who blew smoke into the Viet Cong's underground tunnels, it was Jimi Hendrix's ""Purple Haze."" For a black marine distraught over the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., it was Aretha Franklin's ""Chain of Fools."" And for countless other Vietnam vets, it was ""I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die,"" ""Who'll Stop the Rain,"" or the song that gives this book its title. In We Gotta Get Out of This Place , Doug Bradley and Craig Werner place popular music at the heart of the American experience in Vietnam. They explore how and why U.S. troops turned to music as a way of connecting to each other and the World back home and of coping with the complexities of the war they had been sent to fight. They also demonstrate that music was important for every group of Vietnam veterans -- black and white, Latino and Native American, men and women, officers and ""grunts"" -- whose personal reflections drive the book's narrative. Many of the voices are those of ordinary soldiers, airmen, seamen, and marines. But there are also ""solo"" pieces by veterans whose writings have shaped our understanding of the war -- Karl Marlantes, Alfredo Vea, Yusef Komunyakaa, Bill Ehrhart, Arthur Flowers -- as well as songwriters and performers whose music influenced soldiers' lives, including Eric Burdon, James Brown, Bruce Springsteen, Country Joe McDonald, and John Fogerty. Together their testimony taps into memories -- individual and cultural -- that capture a central if often overlooked component of the American war in Vietnam. -- Provided by publisher},

  author = {Brakhage, Marilyn},
  abstract = {Between 1952 and 2003, depending on how the various serial works are  counted, Stan Brakhage made somewhere between 350 and 400 films, about  half of them short film poems under ten minutes in length, most of the  rest between ten minutes and an hour, and several of them  longer\textemdash including the four and a quarter hours of The Art of Vision (1961\textendash 65). This dauntingly prolific, complex, and both thematically and  materially diverse oeuvre strongly resists categories and labels, and  is difficult to excerpt and anthologize. In selecting titles for this  second collection, I have wished simply to offer further openings into  the enormity of Brakhage's accomplishment, and to allow viewers to  follow some of the evolutions in form and interrelated thematic concerns  that weave through the five decades of his deeply layered, perpetually  transforming, and constantly reimagined ways of seeing. The first Criterion volume presented some major, groundbreaking  achievements of Brakhage's early periods, several important midcareer  films, and fifteen beautiful, short pieces from the late 1980s and  1990s. Volume two includes another thirty exceptional titles, arranged  into six programs (with the option of going directly to any given  title). It was Criterion's Peter Becker who first suggested this  approach, which provides pathways into the work by organizing several  possible viewings of an hour to an hour and a half in length. And I am  thankful also for the valuable input I received in the course of the  selection process from Brakhage scholars Fred Camper, Bruce Elder, and  P. Adams Sitney\textemdash as well as from several other helpful friends and family  members. Presenting a selection of key works from each decade, the  programs proceed in roughly chronological order, while at the same time  giving consideration to a variety of developing themes. Stan Brakhage was a visionary artist who engaged a wide range of subject  matter, creating cinematic revelations of the profound and terrifying  birth of children, the horrors of war, the violence of autopsy, family  life and sexuality, the nature of perception and the developing stages  of human consciousness, the limits of autobiography, animal life on  earth, the earth itself, and our ``connection to the stars.'' His was a  life deeply engaged with the histories of music, poetry, and the visual  arts, an intensely focused, driven, obsessed, creative life in which he  ceaselessly pushed the boundaries of cinematic form to reveal the  universal qualities of our human condition within the singularity of  personal vision, in a musically structured aesthetic of light moving in  time. Before the end of the 1950s, Brakhage was making mostly silent films. As  sound tends to dominate and lead vision, only in silence, he believed,  would it be possible to realize the subtle and complex visual rhythms  that his aesthetics depended upon. He also wrote and spoke of the ``new  language'' of cinema as offering, for the first time, a means of  exteriorizing human thought process. Reflecting upon film's dominant use  to record and re-present theatrical drama, Brakhage increasingly argued  that what film can really do best is to make manifest that which he  came to refer to as ``moving visual thinking''\textemdash that ``non-verbal,  non-symbolic, non-numerical'' thinking that ``at best . . . verges all the  way over . . . into the un-nameable or the ineffable.'' Perceiving the  mind's movements as being in constant interplay with both visually and  sonically received and experienced rhythms, he theorized further that  the aesthetic creation of either visually ordered or sonically ordered  rhythms could present meaningful equivalents of those inner movements,  and he created works in constantly renewing visual forms that would not  only respond to a variety of sights seen\textemdash while simultaneously  manifesting an interior life and documenting complex layers of optic  feedback, or ``closed-eye vision''\textemdash but that would give to the eyes (and  mind) something analogous to what music gives to us through hearing:  ``visual music.'' Frequently, Brakhage's work took the form of extended series or films in  multiple parts (which can also be viewed as separate pieces in their  own right), and from these this volume includes some individual  ``chapters''\textemdash Scenes from Under Childhood, Section One (1967); the  second of the three films of The Weir-Falcon Saga (1970), The Machine  of Eden; Duplicity~III (1980), from the Sincerity and Duplicity  series (1973\textendash 80); the twelfth film of the twenty-part Arabics (1980\textendash 82);  the first part of his major hand-painted Trilogy (1995), I Take  These Truths; and ``. . .'' Reel Five (1998). In addition, we  have included one complete series, Visions in Meditation (1989\textendash 90), in  four parts.  The Visions in Meditation series represents a major turning point in  Brakhage's life and work. A period of personal crisis in the mid-1980s  had led to a brief return to a more psychodramatic mode in his  filmmaking, in the four-part Faust series (1987\textendash 89). With the  magnificent, sweeping landscapes of Faust 4, however, he was  already attempting to rid himself of those dramatic images in ``a return  to earth.'' And it was from there that he launched directly into Visions  in Meditation, with the stated intention of presenting a ``democratic  landscape,'' one in which images of earth, water, sky, structures of  human creation, and human and animal life might coexist in a  nonhierarchical equality of presence\textemdash a weave of light experienced as  rhythms of mind, poised in the balance of thought, envisioned ``as in a  dream.'' Inspired by Gertrude Stein's Stanzas in Meditation, and  filmed as we drove through the American Southwest, as well as the  northeastern states and eastern Canada, visiting historical sites,  iconic landscapes, Brakhage's childhood home in Kansas, and the D. H.  Lawrence shrine in New Mexico, these visions do draw together the  autobiographical energies, landscape meditations, poetic allusions,  celebration of light, equivalents of thought process, and ``music for the  eyes'' that inform and drive much of Brakhage's work. Yet at the same  time, they are astonishingly new in their compositions and rhythms. And  they  introduce a final decade and a half of work as rich and diverse as any  that precedes it. ~ Program 1: 1955\textendash 67 The Wonder Ring, The  Dead, Two: Creeley/McClure, 23rd Psalm BranchProgram one  begins with The Wonder Ring (1955), a six-minute light poem in  homage to what was then Manhattan's soon-to-be demolished Third Avenue  elevated train. This little film was made at the request of Joseph  Cornell, with whom Brakhage collaborated on several projects, and who,  along with Marie Menken, proved to be a major influence on Brakhage's  growing sense of the aesthetics of light and the materiality of the film  medium, as well as on the increasingly subjective and musical qualities  his work would begin to embrace. The Wonder Ring is a film of  quiet warmth, flowing gently round in anticipated memoriam\textemdash those  carriages, those people, those particular views of the city, forever and  never again present.Three years later, shortly after completing  his seminal work Anticipation of the Night (1958)\textemdash in which the  subjective camera of the unseen hero restlessly pursues elliptical  transformations of imagery in an associative montage culminating in the  shadow of a man who has hanged himself\textemdash Brakhage was in Paris, entering  the famous P\`ere Lachaise Cemetery, finding himself faced with the weight  of all those great artists and thinkers who had come before him, and  considering how to turn the symbols of such into a living work. ``The  action of making The Dead,'' Brakhage said, ``kept me alive.''In  the mid-1960s, his 16 mm equipment was stolen and he entered a period  of 8 mm ``home movie'' making with the diverse visual poetics of his 8 mm  Songs, which he introduced with a paraphrasing of Ezra Pound: Go little naked and impudent songs Ring the doorbells of the  bourgeoisie Tell them that you do no work And that you  will live foreverFrom the thirty-one Songs of 1964 to 1969, I've  included two films: the pairing of brief portraits of Brakhage friends,  poets Robert Creeley and Michael McClure (Two: Creeley/McClure, 1965),  which was incorporated into 15 Song Traits (1965), and the  sixty-four-minute study of war and its media presentations 23rd Psalm  Branch (1967), that ``apocalypse of the imagination'' (P. Adams  Sitney) that responded to TV images of Vietnam in an attempt, also, to  reclaim person and personal vision from the onslaught of television  news.Program 2: 1967\textendash 76 Scenes from Under Childhood,  Section One; The Machine of Eden;  Star Garden; DesertProgram 3: 1972\textendash 82 The Process,  Burial Path, Duplicity III, The Domain of the Moment,  Murder Psalm, Arabic 12The first section of Scenes from  Under Childhood begins Brakhage's major investigation into stages of  consciousness (starting with the infant's nascent awareness of self and  other), as well as his formal and thematic layering of autobiographical  reflections with observations of the lives of his children. From the  contemplation of ``birth and being'' in Scenes from Under Childhood (a  film in four parts, 1967\textendash 70), Brakhage turned his considerations to the  further development of consciousness in the three films of The  Weir-Falcon Saga, and to themes of both self-consciousness and  self-deception, the personal and the social, in the eight-part,  autobiographical Sincerity and Duplicity series. In The~Machine of  Eden (part two of The Weir-Falcon Saga), the reemergence into the  larger world of a child who has been feverishly ill (in part one)  becomes the occasion for interweaving the simultaneously perceptual,  formal, and mythological themes of creation/Creation. And in the warm,  autumnal Duplicity III, seen in program three, the viewer is  presented with multiple superimpositions of children engaged in dramatic  play, a strategy whereby the filmmaker reveals the roots of social  roles and evasions, while yet presenting ``drama as an ultimate play for  truth.'' Though he was ostensibly eschewing drama in his  filmmaking of the 1960s and 1970s, in favor of visionary experience of  ordinary dailiness, many of the films from that period\textemdash frequently  centered on home and family\textemdash did, in fact, continue to exhibit clear  dramatic elements, and his awareness of this informed much of the  Sincerity and Duplicity series. However, beginning in the early 1970s, a  major shift was developing in a parallel strand of Brakhage's work, as  ``vision'' was increasingly presented as ``thought process''\textemdash as the interior  light of the mind and the feedback of the nervous system in response to  the incoming light being ``spanked'' in upon it (as he would say) were  given equal weight to any exterior sights.Brakhage's formal,  thematic, and philosophical imperatives of including representations of  optic feedback and the fleeting images of thought in responding to  sights seen can be traced back at least to the making of the childbirth  film Thigh Line Lyre Triangular (1961), in which layers of  superimposition are added to the gestural techniques of the handheld  camera to create a filmic equivalent of inner vision. With The  Process (1972), which begins program three, Brakhage again addresses  the interaction of internal and external sources of imagery, but in  this case, as the sole subject of the film. Here, slightly displaced  positive and negative versions of the same image create a feeling of  insubstantiality. And movements, such as a door being opened or closed,  seem to slide across the plane of the screen, defying our normal sense  of perspective and evoking, instead, brushes of light across a visual  field of mind.Continuing the variable themes of thought process,  Brakhage had paired his 1978 Burial Path with another short film  of that year, Thot Fal'n, noting that, like the earlier piece, Burial  Path ``graphs the process of forgetfulness.'' But Burial Path is also about death, and was sometimes referred to (by Brakhage) as the  third part of a trilogy, with Sirius Remembered (1959) and The  Dead (1960). (The ``path'' is also the route taken to visit  Brakhage's friend, the then-ailing literary scholar Donald Sutherland,  to whom the film is dedicated.)While The Dead is  thematically linked to the other films in that trilogy, it can also be  viewed as one of Brakhage's many studies of or responses to The City,  along with, for examples, Other (1980, Amsterdam), Unconscious  London Strata (1982), City Streaming (1989, Toronto), and,  to some extent, Boulder Blues and Pearls And . . . (1992,  Boulder, Colorado)\textemdash the second and fourth of which are included in  program five of this collection. And all these can equally be seen, once  again, as equivalents of different aspects of thought process\textemdash whether a  study in alienation, a memory piece recalled as rhythms of vision, or a  weave in the mind of what is peripherally seen and absorbed of daily  life in a seeming emotional and optical response to the ephemeral nature  of earthly existence (Boulder Blues).Indeed, Brakhage's  visions\textemdash whether of people known or unknown, whether of earth, ocean, or  sky, whether of Alaskan ice floes, Hawaiian surf, Vancouver Island  beaches, California desert, or Colorado mountains\textemdash seem to exist in a  sort of no-space (or purely filmic space), simultaneously felt as  tactile, visceral sensory experience and ungrounded, associative  dreamscape. But it is precisely in paying attention to the slight shifts  in movement and the playing of the light, the layers of visual rhythms  within the unexpected conjunctions of imagery and changes of  perspective, coming in and out of focus, in a dance of color and form,  in a weave of memory and metaphor, that a viewer might be stirred to a  sudden recognition or insight.The sun makes its way across the  screen in Star Garden (1974) to portray ``one of those days I  would not trade for anything under heaven'' (Brancusi); in Desert (1976), one may ``feel'' the melting heat as if in thought; in Unconscious  London Strata, a viewer can see the familiar shapes and sights  beginning to rhythmically take form from the formless imaginative ground  of mind; and in Boulder Blues and Pearls And . . . , the sights  of daily living are literally colored with overlaid, hand-painted  equivalents of optic feedback elicited by the filmmaker's emotional  response.From the ``moving visual thinking'' of The Process and  Burial Path, program three continues with the reflection upon the  more socially constructed and culturally determined behaviors and  thoughts of Duplicity III, and then a consideration of the  consciousness of other life forms in The Domain of the Moment (1977). Here we see Brakhage turn his camera on four of the animals in  his immediate surroundings. Flora and fauna, flower petals and moth  wings to snakes, donkeys, and goats, his many mysterious cats, as well  as animals occasionally encountered in the wild, would weave their way  through many films, occasionally becoming the focused study of one or  another work. In The Domain of the Moment, the ideal of the  ``continuous present'' that informs much of Brakhage's work finds a  natural parallel in the imagined consciousness of these four creatures.With  Murder Psalm (1980), other considerations arise, it being one of  those works that Brakhage said came to him in a dream, presenting  itself with personal urgency and driven by deep recollections and  disturbances of possible child abuse. A collage of found footage of  monstrous implications, Murder Psalm, like his earlier Nightmare  Series (1978), continues that engagement with the ``dream work'' that  he considered an imperative task of our age.Around this same  time, Brakhage was also beginning a new and important evolution in his  work. The thought-process films of 1978 (Thot Fal'n and Burial  Path) can perhaps be seen as a bridge between such earlier works as  The Process and The Text of Light (1974) and the  so-called Imagnostic Films of his Roman Numeral Series (1979\textendash 80) and  then Arabics. In these later photographic abstractions, Brakhage took  his next leap into the orchestration of pure light and refracted colors,  drawing on the perceived inner movements of the mind, the qualities of  music, and the inherent nature of film to present us with a vision of  what he believed to be the inner ``grammar'' that formed the structural  basis of all thought.Brakhage often spoke of the psychological  dangers inherent in the work of the abstract expressionists, with whom  he felt an aesthetic affinity. And the extreme interiority, the deep  dives into fundamental thought process that brought forth his Roman  Numeral Series, Arabics, and Egyptian Series (1984), as well as  the painting of The Dante Quartet (1987, volume one), would have  presented potential threats to mental stability that demanded a  regrounding in something quite opposite. The complexities of private  relationships within a self-defining and obsessed creative life (or any  life) should not be oversimplified, nor do I wish to presume upon them.  Yet among the vicissitudes of his life, this isolated and deeply  interiorized creative production certainly must have contributed to his  increasing desire for more active collaboration, and to counterbalancing  moves that deeply affected his personal and aesthetic life in those  years. And certainly the psychically demanding nature of the work took  its toll on him and those around him. To a large extent, this had always  been so. And in the mid-1980s, perhaps for these as well as other  reasons, there was a somewhat dramatic tearing apart and shattering of  his personal and family life, leading, eventually, to the end of his  long marriage to Jane Collom Brakhage (now Jane Wodening)\textemdash the partner in  life and art who had so frequently and prominently figured in his films  of the preceding three decades. It was in the aftermath of this drama  that I first met Stan Brakhage. About a year later, in 1988, we would  begin a series of driving trips together in which he finished the  photography for Faust 4 and began his Visions in Meditation.Program  4: 1989\textendash 90 Visions in Meditation \#1, Visions in Meditation \#2  (Mesa Verde), Visions in Meditation \#3 (Plato's Cave), Visions in  Meditation \#4 (D. H. Lawrence)Program 5: 1982, 1992, 1994 Unconscious  London Strata, Boulder Blues and Pearls And . . . , The Mammals of  Victoria, From: First Hymn to the Night\textemdash NovalisFor many  years, Brakhage was based in the mountains of Colorado, and later in the  town of Boulder. At the same time, when he traveled to new geographies,  the immediacy of his engagement with the particularities of light and  rhythms of those other places or their specific cultural manifestations  would produce some of his most deeply felt works. This is true of Creation (1979) and Made Manifest (1980) (Alaska and Hawaii,  respectively), and of the Visions in Meditation series, as well as Unconscious  London Strata, City Streaming, and the monumental Vancouver Island  Quartet (1991\textendash 2002)\textemdash filmed in the environs of my own childhood, a  place to which we returned repeatedly through the 1990s.Brakhage  described Unconscious London Strata as a ``reconstruction of the  mind's eye at the borders of the unconscious,'' writing that ``some visual  song of all of England's history began to move through this material,''  creating, then, a musical metaphor of mind, as memory manifested on film  as ``rounds within rounds.'' The Mammals of Victoria (1994), the  second of the Vancouver Island films, is an elemental study in the  energies of adolescence\textemdash another example of that particular strand in  Brakhage's work (as is Boulder Blues and Pearls And . . .) in  which he would combine photographic and painted imagery, assuredly  weaving together the shimmering fragility of worldly phenomena and  visual experience with both concrete and metaphorical representations of  an interior life.Shortly after the shooting of The Mammals  of Victoria, Brakhage decided to devote himself entirely to his  hand-painted work\textemdash a determination that lasted for about three years.  Layers of Brakhagean hand-painted expressions can be traced back to the  early 1960s, from Thigh Line Lyre Triangular, Dog Star Man (1961\textendash 64,  volume one), and a number of the Songs to The Wold-Shadow of  1972 (volume one), the completely hand-painted Skein (1974), Aftermath (1980), Nodes (1981), and up to and including The Dante  Quartet and Interpolations (1992). From 1993 to late 1996,  Brakhage wanted to fully explore the possibilities of this aesthetic,  and he produced more than forty short films, in a remarkable outpouring  of work, in a form that would continue to be a major part of his  filmmaking to the end of his life. From these, the present anthology  includes the beautiful short film of rich painting and overlaid  scratched words From: First Hymn to the Night\textemdash Novalis (1994), as  well as his tour de force I Take These Truths and a selection  from the later Persian Series (1999\textendash 2001).Program 6:  1995\textendash 2003  I Take These Truths, The Cat of the Worm's Green Realm, Yggdrasill:  Whose Roots Are Stars in the Human Mind, ``. . .'' Reel Five, Persian  Series 1\textendash 3, Chinese SeriesIn late 1996 and 1997, Brakhage's work evidenced a partial  return to photographic aesthetics, with Commingled Containers (volume one) and The Cat of the Worm's Green Realm, as well as  the ecstatic paean to earthly existence, with intimations, perhaps, of  immortality, that is Yggdrasill: Whose Roots Are Stars in the Human  Mind. With this film, Brakhage alludes to the World Tree as he  portrayed it in his 1964 epic Dog Star Man. And in later  conversation (with filmmaker Phil Solomon), he explained his wish to  correct himself, saying that ``it [the World Tree] cannot die\textemdash as I had it  in Dog Star Man\textemdash because . . . it comes from the human mind and  belongs to the human mind.'' A ``document'' of thought process, sparked, as  he said, by images of electricity and growth, this film combines  photography and paint within an astonishing recapitulation of themes and  forms that is a masterpiece of complex visual rhythms. In 1998,  Brakhage completed the five reels of Ellipses, culminating in the only  sound piece of that series. ``. . .'' Reel Five is one of four  sound films included in this volume, and it is the third film that  Brakhage made with the music of his longtime friend composer James  Tenney (following upon Interim [1952] and Christ Mass Sex  Dance [1991]). For ``. . .'' Reel Five, Brakhage edited his  scratched and painted film to Tenney's previously recorded Flocking so as to give equal weight to each element\textemdash the primary principle in  this form of construction being one of nonsynchronization, of breaking  any direct connection between picture and sound so as to allow each to  develop independently. It is a profoundly moving work of acceptance and  generosity in which each aspect\textemdash the visual and the aural\textemdash is fully alive  in the presence of the other, in a remarkable evocation of space, time,  and aesthetic correspondence.Across his life, Brakhage was  inspired not only to contemplate and make manifest his own thought  process and visual experience but to consider the shared, cultural  aspects of those forms, and to explore the variations of shapes, colors,  forms, and movements that might typify the underlying thought process  of a given culture. While his Roman Numeral Series, Arabics, Egyptian  Series, and Babylon Series (1989\textendash 90) were all photographed  abstractions of colored light, the first several Persians are from a  series of eighteen short, painted films that present a beautiful  tapestry of colors with dark overtones, the overall series moving  gradually toward scriptlike lines. And Brakhage's last film, the  hand-scratched Chinese Series (2003)\textemdash finished just weeks before  his death\textemdash flickers across the screen as suggestions of Chinese  ideograms, while at the same time, as filmmaker Courtney Hoskins would  have it, evoking a sense of ``running through a humid bamboo forest . . .  [in which] green and yellow stalks create these glowing shadows as they  cut across the sunlight.''While remaining true to inner sources  and seeking to go beyond language into the realm of the unnameable,  Brakhage films are also dense with visual metaphors and literary  allusion. They may shimmer with the mundane grittiness of life on earth,  with delicate flickers of closed-eye vision and suggestions of the very  birth of imagery, or explode into ecstatic expansions of mind and the  infinities of celestial space. The images are fleeting, ephemeral, and  unpredictable. They defy any simple interpretation. Yet Brakhage would  state that he had very high standards for film as a possible art form,  and that in any work of art there will be nothing superfluous. These  works do demand the active participation of the viewer, and invite  repeated viewings. Yet ultimately, according to Brakhage, the form and  content of a work of art will be fully explicable. The adventure is in  the imaginative engagement with the multiplicity of possibilities,  surprising revelations, and intensification of visual experience that  these films can give to us. I am very thankful to everyone who  worked so hard to make this production possible.And to quote  Stan once again, as he wrote of 15 Song Traits, I would like to  dedicate this collection ``to all who appear within these films\textemdash and to  all who see them clearly.''},

Notes on the Cinematograph is not only his definitive treatise on film--its inherent peculiarity and potential--but an ascetic meditation on how art transcends, and is transformed by, the senses. Bresson upends inherited truths with empirical ones, calling for film to divest itself of the trappings of theater in order to come into its own as an art form. While theater is capable of simulation, film can capture immanent being. Therefore, he argues, the two forms are innately at odds: "No marriage of theater and cinematography without both being exterminated." To this end, Bresson rechristens his actors "models" and conducts them through grueling shoots where they repeat their lines and movements until he deems them vacant of actorly intention and charged, instead, with inscrutability: "A model. Enclosed in his mysterious appearance. He has brought home to him all of him that was outside. He is there, behind that forehead, those cheeks.""--},

After describing motivations for use of nonlinear projection, we provide a brief survey of different techniques for nonlinear projection described in computer graphics literature. We then examine several cases of how and when artists choose to use nonlinear projection, as opposed to perspective projection, and how these might be achieved with current computer graphics techniques. Lastly, we provide a synopsis of the Flexible Projection Framework and then describe how it was used in a collaborative project between an artist and a computer scientist.},

The focus is on the first century that starts the numerical countdown to the present. All of the schemata of modernity\textemdash time, space, concepts, and categories [as in Kant's First Critique]\textemdash are put to the test of comprehending this alleged beginning, and none survives unscathed. Walter Benjamin's understanding of the task of the translator, when applied to historical rather than linguistic translation, provides the methodological armature for the analysis. The excerpt printed here is the methodological introduction to Chapter 2: ``Translations in Time.''},

Sergei Eisenstein, who was influenced by these experiments, organized his theatrical productions as a chain of independent fragments capable of entering any possible combination/recombination and labelled this method ``montage of attractions''. He used the same montage principle not only for a new theatrical or cinematic narrative but also to conceptualize the expressive movement of the theatrical or cinematic body created on stage and on screen. Finally he conceptualized montage not only as a means of conveying movement, but also of conveying a way of thinking. This inspired him to create a new form of scientific narrative in his two unfinished books. The subject to be analysed in the first book from 1929 \textendash montage \textendash{} inspired him to look for a new structure by organizing different texts in the form of a sphere. This form defined the method of writing his second project on the theory of the arts as a hypertext. Eisenstein gave this book the title Method (1932\textendash 1948).},

These relate to three specific modes of fictioning: performance fictioning, science fictioning and machine fictioning. In this way, Burrows and O'Sullivan explore how fictioning can offer us alternatives to the dominant fictions that construct our reality in an age of 'post-truth' and 'perception management'. Through fictioning, they look forward to the new kinds of human, part-human and non-human bodies and societies to come. - from book jacket},

  abstract = {"Thought experiments have long been a vital part of the creative, intellectual process in modern science-and, by extension, so have "demons." Demons are hypothetical beings imagined by scientists to perform specific roles within thought experiments-embodying special powers or abilities and personifying tough intellectual challenges or highlighting apparent paradoxes. They are used as a way of exploring what would happen if one fiddled with or upset the sturdiest of physical laws, or experimented with physical or natural processes or phenomena in ways that the scientist imagining them otherwise could not. As such, they help clarify the limits of what is possible in the physical world, or show weaknesses in our understanding of an observable phenomenon, or highlight cracks in a hypothesis or theory. Unencumbered by the physicality of our concrete world, demons are thus useful to scientists in their intellectual quest to understand how nature works, and in the creative exploration of the frontiers of science"--},

  abstract = {In this paper I employ the notion of the `thought of the outside' as developed by Michel Foucault, in order to defend the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze against the criticisms of `elitism,' `aristocratism,' and `political indifference'\textemdash famously leveled by Alain Badiou and Peter Hallward. First, I argue that their charges of a theophanic conception of Being, which ground the broader political claims, derive from a misunderstanding of Deleuze's notion of univocity, as well as a failure to recognize the significance of the concept of multiplicity in Deleuze's thinking. From here, I go on to discuss Deleuze's articulation of the `dogmatic image of thought,' which, insofar as it takes `recognition' as its model, can only ever think what is already solidified and sedimented as true, in light of existing structures and institutions of power. Then, I examine Deleuze's reading of Foucault and the notion of the `thought of the outside,' showing the `outside' as the unthought that lies at the heart of thinking itself, as both its condition and its impossibility. Insofar as it is essential to thinking itself, finally, I argue that the passage of thought to the outside is not an absolute flight out of this world, as Hallward claims, but rather, a return of the different that constitutes the Self for Deleuze. Thinking is an ongoing movement of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, or as Foucault says, death and life. Thinking, as Deleuze understands it, is essentially creative; it reconfigures the virtual, thereby literally changing the world. Thinking is therefore, according to Deleuze, thoroughly political.},

  abstract = {Philosophical reflection on the emotions has a long history stretching back to classical Greek thought, even though at times philosophers have marginalized or denigrated them in favour of reason. Fourteen leading philosophers here offer a broad survey of the development of our understanding of the emotions. The thinkers they discuss include Aristotle, Aquinas, Ockham, Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza, Hobbes, Hume, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Kant, Schiller, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, James, Brentano, Stumpf, Scheler, Heidegger, and Sartre. Central issues include the taxonomy of the emotions; the distinction between emotions, passions, feelings and moods; the relation between the emotions and reason; the relationship between the self and the emotions. At a metaphilosophical level, the collection also raises issues about the value of historical study of the discipline, and what light it can shed on contemporary concerns. 'Thinking about the Emotions' is a fascinating and illuminating collective study of how philosophers have grappled with this most intriguing part of our nature as beings who feel as well as think and act},

It takes the position that film theory is a form of writing that produces a unique cinematic grammar; and like all grammars, it forms part of the system of rules that govern a language, and is thus applicable to wider range of media forms. In their creation of authorial trends, identification of the technology of cinema as a creative force, and production of films as aesthetic markers, film theories contribute an epistemological resource that connects the technologies of filmmaking and film composition. This book explores these connections through film theorisations of processes of the diagrammatisation (the systems, methodologies, concepts, histories) of cinematic matters of the filmic world."--Page 4 of cover},

  abstract = {Many human beings have considered the powers and the limits of human knowledge, but few have wondered about the power that the idea of knowledge has over us. Steven Connor's The Madness of Knowledge is the first book to investigate this emotional inner life of knowledge - the lusts, fantasies, dreams, and fears that the idea of knowing provokes. There are in-depth discussions of the imperious will to know, of Freud's epistemophilia (or love of knowledge), and the curiously insistent links between madness, magical thinking, and the desire for knowledge. Connor also probes secrets and revelations, quarreling and the history of quizzes and "general knowledge," charlatanry and pretension, both the violent disdain and the sanctification of the stupid, as well as the emotional investment in the spaces and places of knowledge, from the study to the library. In an age of artificial intelligence, alternative facts, and mistrust of truth, The Madness of Knowledge offers an opulent, enlarging, and sometimes unnerving psychopathology of intellectual life. -- From Publisher, page 2 of cover.},

Vertical screens also align with the celluloid strips that run vertically through nearly all projectors, whose properties were interrogated by postwar avant-gardes and have taken on renewed urgency in light of celluloid's impending obsolescence. Finally, the luminous verticality of stained glass windows helped define the Gothic order, which provided a model for avant-garde experiments in light and space for a century or more, and which have suddenly returned to centre stage in contemporary art. Elcott's three distinct paradigms map a centuries-long encounter with vertical screens that resonate unexpectedly yet unambiguously in the present.},

Bloomington: Indiana university Press) is the place where he gives his fullest discussion of a major art medium which is somewhat neglected in aesthetics, namely sculpture. The structure of argument in `Art and Space' is cryptic even by Heidegger's standards. The small amount of literature tends to focus on the paper's role within Heidegger's own oeuvre as an expression of changes in his understanding of space. This is ironic; for Heidegger's main thematic in the essay is the way in which space is overcome in the creation of sculpture. Of course, by virtue of its three-dimensional character, sculpture seems to be a spatial medium, par excellence. The counter-intuitive character of Heidegger's position requires, accordingly, that his argumentative strategy be scrutinized very closely. In this paper, therefore, I will examine closely the structure of Heidegger's argument, with the aim of understanding, rectifying, and then developing his most important insights. My ultimate aim is to show the subtle, but radical points which are at issue in Heidegger's arguments, and to develop them much further in the clarification of sculpture's key philosophical significance.},

  abstract = {This book presents the first sustained articulation of a Foucauldian \oe uvre. It situates Foucault's critique within the tradition of Kant's call for a philosophical archaeology of reason; in parallel, it demonstrates the priority in Foucault's thought of Nietzsche over Heidegger and the framing of reason against an ontology of power. Bregham Dalgliesh hereby claims that at the heart of the Foucauldian \oe uvre is the philosophical method of critical history. Its task is to make the will to know that drives thought conscious of itself as a problem, especially the regimes of truth that define our governmentalities. By revealing the contingency of their constituent parts of knowledge, power and ethics, Dalgliesh demonstrates that critical history offers an alternative mode of critique to the hithertofore singular reading of the intellectual heritage of enlightenment, while it fosters an agonistic concept of freedom in respect of our putatively necessary limits.},

  abstract = {This anthology exposes the richness and variety of interests that motivate feminist film research today. Exploring women?s contribution to silent cinema, scholars from across the globe address questions of performance, nationality, industry, technology, labor, and theory of feminist historiography. The volume builds on the thematic, methodological, and material diversity that characterized earlier efforts in women?s film history, and the originating context of the sixth Women and the Silent Screen conference (Bologna, 2010). Much emphasis is given to the transitional period of silent cinema (1910s to the early 1920s), which emerges as the field where feminist film scholars are beginning to claim their own theoretical and historical ?place?. While giving a new impetus to the idea of transitional cinema, the collected essays also illuminate the importance of film?s transnational circulation. Questions of nation and nationhood, and women?s inclusion or exclusion within these terms, are examined in connection to issues of cultural globalization. How did American serial queens impact early Chinese film? How did the variety stage accommodate American films in Rio de Janeiro? Along what lines might we discuss women filmmakers who literally toured the world? These are just some of the issues that are discussed in the volume. Each investigation prompts us into distinct acts of cultural contextualization. A particular focus on acting and the agency of the actress is shared across the volume. The fundamental figure of the actress links multiple threads of scholarship, traversing different films and national cinemas. Alice Guy, Asta Nielsen, Florence Turner, Lois Weber, Mary Pickford, Esfir? Shub, Pearl White, Vera Karalli, Aleksandra Khokhlova, Elsa Lanchester, Louise Fazenda, Sarah Bernhardt, Gemma Bellincioni, Angelina Buracci, Yin Mingzhu, Leni Riefensthal: these are but some of the names that are encountered across the essays in the collection. New findings are exposed and new research perspectives are opened through these and other figures, allowing us to uncover original ways of thinking about women?s visibility and agency on film.},

  abstract = {Foucault's (1975) edited book, I, Pierre Rivi\`ere, having slaughtered my mother, my sister and my brother. A case of parricide in the 19th century, includes the court documents and newspaper reports from the 1835 trial of Pierre Rivi\`ere, Pierre Rivi\`ere's memoir written while in prison, and the ``analytic notes'' written by Foucault and his colleagues. Whereas the court focused on the question of whether Pierre Rivi\`ere was of sane mind or not, Foucault and his colleagues sought to avoid the closure that such categorical thinking invites the reader into. This paper introduces the story of Pierre Rivi\`ere, and opens up some of the questions to be addressed in this special issue. The papers examine the memoir, the accompanying documents, and Foucault's and his colleagues' take on them, and reopen discussion of the Pierre Rivi\`ere case and its contemporary twenty-first century relevance, using a combination of both philosophical ethnography and arts-based enquiry. These contemporary papers are based upon a series of interdisciplinary workshops and seminars that took place at the University of Bristol during 2010. In this introductory paper we ask what was the emotional geography of this young man who engaged in such an unthinkable act? And how did that geography intersect with the emotional geography of his village in France in 1835, and what does it still have to tell us about our own contemporary society? \'O 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Deleuze stresses the morphogenetic capability of matter to generate form on its own and argues that the role of virtual singularities and of the diagrammatic and problematic nature of reality can only be grasped during the process of morphogenesis; that is, before the final form is actualized. Deleuze focuses on far-fromequilibrium conditions since it is only in these "phase spaces" (as he calls them in his 1994 book Difference and Repetition) that difference-driven morphogenesis comes into its own, and that matter becomes an active material agent which does not need form to impose itself onto it from the outside. The process behind this formation is a double movement of sorting and consolidation. The essay maps this diagrammatic operation described by Deleuze onto the fields of society, geology and evolution.},

Born into a German-Jewishfamily, she was forced to leave Germany in 1933 and lived in Paris forthe next eight years, working for a number of Jewish refugeeorganisations. In 1941 she immigrated to the United States and soonbecame part of a lively intellectual circle in New York. She held anumber of academic positions at various American universities untilher death in 1975. She is best known for two works that had a majorimpact both within and outside the academic community. The first,The Origins of Totalitarianism, published in 1951, was astudy of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes that generated a wide-rangingdebate on the nature and historical antecedents of the totalitarianphenomenon. The second, The Human Condition, published in1958, was an original philosophical study that investigated thefundamental categories of the vita activa (labor, work,action). In addition to these two important works, Arendt published anumber of influential essays on topics such as the nature ofrevolution, freedom, authority, tradition and the modern age. At thetime of her death in 1975, she had completed the first two volumes ofher last major philosophical work, The Life of the Mind,which examined the three fundamental faculties of the vitacontemplativa (thinking, willing, judging).},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, I advance a new interpretation of Heidegger's reflections on art as we find them in his essay, `The Origin of the Work of Art'. I begin, in Section 1, by uncovering the fundamental concern that motivates Heidegger's essay. I show that Heidegger's reflections on art are part of his attempt to uncover a path beyond the history of metaphysics. I then suggest, in Section 2, that while Heidegger does think that art may allow for the overcoming of metaphysics, recent interpreters [Dreyfus (), Thomson (), and Young ()] have mistook the kind of art that Heidegger has in mind here. The kind of art that can allow for the overcoming of metaphysics, I argue, is not art that simply thematizes and/or reconfigures cultural worlds (as these interpreters have argued). It is instead what Heidegger calls `primal poesy'. After discussing the nature of primal poesy, I show in more detail how this kind of art may be capable of getting us beyond the history of metaphysics in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, I reconsider the more common reading of `The Origin of the Work of Art' in light of the interpretation I've offered in Sections 2 and 3.},

This is the empiricist conversion.' What are we to make of such a calling? The paper explicates why and in what sense this statement is of exemplary significance both for an appropriate understanding of Deleuze's political thought and for a most timely conceptualisation of politics in a world so clearly defined by immanence, and nothing but immanence. I argue that Deleuze's rigorously constructive approach to the world is not beyond politics, as some recent readings have declared (e.g. those of Badiou and Hallward). Rather, we have to appreciate that in Deleuze and Guattari's demand for a `belief in this world' the political intersects with the dimension of the ethical in such a way that our understanding of both is transformed. Only after this `empiricist conversion' can we truly think of a Deleuzian politics that does justice to a plane of immanence `immanent only to itself'.},

One of Dreyfus' central contributions to reading the historical canon of philosophy comes from his recognition that great philosophers help us to understand the 'background practices' of a culture - the practices that shape and embody our most basic understanding of ourselves and the things and situations we encounter in our world. Background practices are all too often overlooked completely, or else their importance is misunderstood. Each chapter in this volume shows in one way or another how a broad range of philosophical topics can only be properly understood when we recognize how they are grounded in the background practices that shape our lives and give meaning to our activities, our tasks, our normative commitments, our aims and our goals},

  abstract = {At the heart of Heidegger's thought is the notion of being, and the same can be said of power in the works of Foucault. And, just as Heidegger offers a history of being, culminating in the technological understanding of being, in order to help us understand and overcome our current way of dealing with things as objects, Foucault analyses several regimes of power, culminating in modern bio-power, in order to help us free ourselves from understanding ourselves as subjects. I argue that these parallels arise because Foucault's notion of power denotes the social aspect of what Heidegger calls the clearing. That is, while Heidegger is concerned with the coordination of everyday practices that makes possible the disclosure of all types of entities, Foucault is concerned with the practices that determine what, at any given time, it makes sense for people to do. Heidegger further claims that, since the Greeks, the clearing has been misunderstood. He calls this misunderstanding, which sees intelligibility as emanating from a highest being, onto-theology. This corresponds to Foucault's claim that, from Plato on, people have had a mistaken conception of power as monarchical, that is, as imposed from above. Finally, both understand our current cultural condition as particularly dangerous because our practices are totalizing, and so are wiping out the marginal practices in terms of which our current understanding of being could be resisted, thereby removing the resources that could give rise to new understandings of being and of power. In the end, however, Heidegger and Foucault differ radically. Heidegger stresses that we can only preserve endangered practices by being open to the gathering power of things, while Foucault insists on the wilful and active resistance involved in transforming oneself into a work of art.},

  abstract = {This article aims to trace and articulate the extremely rich production and postproduction history of the early Soviet classic, Sergei Eisenstein's Bronenosets Potemkin (The Battleship Potemkin, 1925). By engaging Paolo Cherchi Usai's idea that early films exist as multiple objects, the paper explicates how Eisenstein's film was re-edited in three of its most important versions: the original 1925 cut; the first international cut, produced in 1926; and the 1950 cut. By elucidating the distinctive sociopolitical conditions that crucially informed all three cuts of the film, the article interprets and compares the visual transformation of Potemkin in accordance with editorial and re-editorial alterations, identifying a nexus of contributing factors that regulate the economy of the visible in Eisenstein's film. I argue that the junction at which authoritative social impulses are negotiated with Eisenstein's individual vision takes us to what might be one of the critical moments in Eisenstein's early career in which his early, avant-garde\&\#x2013;informed approach to filmmaking is recalibrated with the rules of dramaturgy of film form.},

  abstract = {This publication poses the question of Nauman's contemporaneity and situates his oeuvre in the context of artistic positions and art theoretical discourses from the last decades. Six in-depth essays illuminate Nauman's work, such as in regard to its inherent humour or the practice of endless repetition. The volume of texts examines the mirror image and rear-view figures, for example, along with questions of contemporary subject constitution, digital image production and cybernetics. Theories of labour and globalisation are discussed in reference to Nauman's creative output, as well as the connections between Nauman's work and models of behaviourism, software and computer theory, or topology. The essays consider Nauman's oeuvre in relation to diverse artistic positions such as those of Ed Atkins, Erwin Wurm, Francis Al\"ys, Fischli / Weiss, Dara Birnbaum, Yvonne Rainer or Ren\'e Magritte. In so doing, it seeks to counter the tendency to cast the artist as an outstanding solitary figure of postmodernism and opens up manifold references.

  abstract = {The first English-language monograph devoted to the full oeuvre of Alexander Kluge, the prolific German filmmaker, television producer, digital entrepreneur, author, thinker, and public intellectual. Alexander Kluge (born 1932) is a German filmmaker, author, television producer, theorist, and digital entrepreneur. Since 1960, he has made fourteen feature films and twenty short films and has written more than thirty books--including three with Marxist philosopher Oskar Negt. His television production company has released more than 3,000 features, in which Kluge converses with real or fictional experts or creates thematic montages. He also maintains a website on which he reassembles segments from his film and television work. To call Kluge "prolific" would be an understatement. This is the first English-language monograph devoted to the full scope of Kluge's work, from his appearance on the cultural scene in the 1960s to his contributions to New German Cinema in the 1970s and early 1980s to his recent collaborations with such artists as Gerhard Richter. In Toward Fewer Images, Philipp Ekardt offers both close analyses of Kluge's individual works and sustained investigations of his overarching (and perpetual) production. Ekardt discusses Kluge's image theory and practice as developed across different media, and considers how, in relation to this theory, Kluge returns to, varies, expands, and modifies the practice of montage, including its recent manifestations in digital media--noting Kluge's counterintuitive claim that creating montages results in fewer images. Kluge's production, Ekardt argues, allows us to imagine a model of authorship and artistic production that does not rely on an accumulation of individual works over time but rather on a permanent activity of (temporalized) reworking and redifferentiation.},

The resulting complex, Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time. Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 33\% of the specific ATPase activity of the bound myosin is retained. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85\% of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits. The adenosine triphosphatase of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying pH, ionic strength, and cation concentration. The ATPase profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are found. The Sepharose-Myosin ATPase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent KM is approximately two-fold higher than that of myosin. These differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix.},

The case is very different with the subject of the following article. For reasons connected with the history of modern architecture and the ideals of certain of the most articulate of its pioneers and theorists, monumentality is a word which, encountered on the printed page, provokes in most of us an instant reaction of a non-rational kind. Yet, as Professor Elliott points out, there has as a matter of historical fact been a revival of monumentality, and of the monument too, during the past two decades. In view of this, the time has clearly come for a reconsideration of the subject of monuments and monumentality.]},

  abstract = {The Sicily-born, Berlin-based artist Rosa Barba is known for an engagement with filmic materiality in which obsolescence is never far out of the frame. And yet the artisanal is conspicuously absent from her practice. Although Barba activates our current nostalgia for old media, she seems acutely aware of the irony inherent within it. Barba turns to the medium precisely as part of a larger excavation of twentieth-century encounters between nature and technology--an undertaking she also pursues at the level of content, through images of blighted land and toxic waste. In the many works she has produced over the past decade, film is nothing quaint or fragile. It is a sturdy survivor of one machine age that we encounter from deep within another.},

Ein popul\"arer bildlicher Topos der Zeit war die Darstellung des leeren Ateliers. Der vorliegende Beitrag versteht das Bild des leeren Ateliers im 19. Jahrhundert als ein Selbstportr\"at des K\"unstlers. Er untersucht, wie die Darstellung des Raums und seiner Objekte dem Gem\"alde die Pr\"asenz des K\"unstlers einschreiben und sein bzw. ihr k\"unstlerisches~ Selbstverst\"andnis innerhalb der sich ver\"andernden k\"unstlerischen und sozialen Strukturen der Epoche wiedergeben.{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}From the Romantic era onward, many of the discourses surrounding artistic creativity have merged the artist and his working space: the place of work is viewed as the mirror of the man and his oeuvre, a sanctuary, a social or an exhibition space. A popular topos in this context was the view of the empty studio. This paper explores the 19th-century empty studio image as a self-portrait of the artist. It examines how the depictions of the space and its objects work to inscribe the artist's presence, and to express his or her~ artistic self-conception and identity within the changing artistic-social structures of the period.},

It covers a broad range of magical, mystical and phenomenological interactions between the two media, from early film's eroticized tableaux vivants to enigmatic sculptures in modernist cinema. Sculptures are literally brought to life on the silver screen, while living people are turned into, or trapped inside, statuary. The book examines key sculptural motifs and cinematic sculpture in film history through a series of case studies and through an extensive reference gallery of 150 different films. Considering the work of directors like Georges Melies, Jean Cocteau and Alain Resnais, as well as films like House of Wax, Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans, this is an innovative exploration of two different media, their artistic traditions and their respective theoretical paradigms},

Psychologist and writer Charles Fernyhough tells stories of everyone from children to people who hear voices and reveals how our inner voices play a vital part in our thinking. Charles Fernyhough is a Professor in the Department of Psychology, Durham University.

His work has contributed to our understanding of how language and thought are related in child development and beyond and his most recent focus has been on applying mainstream developmental psychology to the study of psychosis.},

  abstract = {In From Grain to Pixel, Giovanna Fossati analyzes the transition from analog to digital film and its profound effects on filmmaking and film archiving. Reflecting on the theoretical conceptualization of the medium itself, Fossati poses significant questions about the status of physical film and the practice of its archival preservation, restoration, and presentation. From Grain to Pixel attempts to bridge the fields of film archiving and academic research by addressing the discourse on film's ontology and analyzing how different interpretations of what film is affect the role and practices of film archives. By proposing a novel theorization of film archival practice, Fossati aims to stimulate a renewed dialogue between film scholars and film archivists. Almost a decade after its first publication, this revised edition covers the latest developments in the field. Besides a new general introduction, a new conclusion, and extensive updates to each chapter, a novel theoretical framework and an additional case study have been included.

  abstract = {"The course given by Michel Foucault from February to March 1984, under the title 'The Courage of Truth', was his last at the Coll\`ege de France. His death shortly after, on June 25th, tempts us to detect a philosophical testament in these lectures, especially in view of the prominence they give to the theme of death, notably through a reinterpretation of Socrates' last words--'Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius'--which, with Georges Dum\'ezil, Foucault understands as the expression of a profound gratitude towards philosophy for its cure of the only serious illness: that of false opinions and prejudices. These lectures continue and radicalize the analyses of those of the previous year. Foucault's 1983 lectures investigated the function of 'truth telling' in politics in order to establish courage and conviction as ethical conditions for democracy irreducible to the formal rules of consensus. With the Cynics, this manifestation of the truth no longer appears simply as a risky speaking out, but in the very substance of existence. In fact, Foucault offers an incisive study of ancient Cynicism as practical philsophy, athleticism of the truth, public provocation, and ascetic sovereignty. The scandal of the true life is constructed in oppositon to Platonism and its world of transcendent intelligible forms"--Publisher's description, p. [2] of dust jacket},

For most of the twentieth century, the making of cartoons was mechanized and standardized: thousands of drawings were inked and painted onto individual transparent celluloid sheets (called 'cels') and then photographed in succession, a labor-intensive process that was divided across scores of artists and technicians. In order to understand the art, labor, and technology of cel animation, this book analyzes cartoons frame by frame to expose hitherto unseen qualities of the image. What emerges is both a method and an original account of an art formed on the assembly line"--Provided by publisher},

In Virilio's writing, the screen serves as the locus of lost dimensions of space and technological transformations of time; it modifies our relation to space, is a surface-mount for its `accelerated virtualization'. If Virilio does not theorize the technological differences between film, television and the computer, I argue, it is because, for him, the screen remains in a metaphoric register, a virtual surface which overrides any specificities of its media formation.},

Despite a historical sensibility being essential in making critical and directional choices, Design History presents an extremely selective view, which cannot deliver the historical knowledge to sufficiently and sensitively inform designers and design thinkers' practice. Focusing on how the relationship between design and history is understood and presented, this book uses a methodological approach to address this problem. The book covers the issue of history and how design in history needs to be understood by recognising that design is always historically embedded in a relational context; the efficacy of Design History as a sub-discipline within design; and the delivery of a more substantial historical sensibility to emergent designers, identifying the pedagogic problems it presents and discussing the agency of such knowledge in practice. This book is the flagship of the Design, History \& Futures series, edited by Tony Fry, Lisa Norton and Anne-Marie Willis"--},

  abstract = {This article offers an account of the advent of digital editing, or digital montage. While reference is often made in film theory to the ``ontological'' effects of technological change, the term itself is rarely defined in explicit fashion. Following the philosopher Gregory Currie, the author argues that an ontological analysis cannot begin from an accounting of any putatively necessary or definitive physical aspect of the cinema as a medium. Indeed, the author argues, following No\"el Carroll, that the cinema is not a ``medium,'' but rather an art form that employs a wide range of media. In the transition from film editing to digital montage, the means for the creation of multimedia, audiovisual cinematic compositions have been consolidated in so far as most media are now rendered in digital form, allowing for more comprehensive and fine-grained manipulations and modifications. On the basis of a more adequate account of the ontology of the cinema, this can be seen as continuous with the history of film art.},

The authors argue that such software must be understood in relation to specific cinematic discourses and in the context of longstanding promises of popular participation in `movie-making'. They situate the historically sedimented nature of audiovisual experience in terms of a geneaology of non-commercial film editing and filmmaking, and analyse the phenomenological mixture of constraints and potentials embodied by individual amateur filmmakers and implemented in popular consumer-level editing software. The figure of the video editor (the software and the individual), the authors argue, incorporates a compromise inherent to cinematic life between the propensity to `make' by appropriating forms and materials from the cinema, and the material, economic and legal constraints on making that preserve the organization of entertainment industries.},

Tristan Garcia argues that such intensity rarely lives up to its promise. It always comes at a price: one that defines the ethical predicament of contemporary life. The notion of intensity was the hidden key to Garcia's landmark book Form and Object. In The Life Intense, the first part of his ambitious Letting Be trilogy, he begins to develop it in detail. This first book focuses on ethics; the forthcoming two books look at politics and metaphysics respectively."--Publisher's description},

The school of thought that Austin's name is usually linked with -- 'ordinary language philosophy' -- is often overlooked today.

We will suggest a few avenues of investigation which may be able to account for the identity processes followed by different media. In this respect we think it is important to understand how a new medium gradually finds its 'identity' while at the same time expressing, in a more-or-less unique manner, a quality of intermediality, whose presence is constant and irrepressible. When a medium appears, an intelligible media culture already exists. When a medium comes into the world, it must also get to grips with pre-established codes (genres, institutions, other media, etc). What we hope to demonstrate here is the extent to which the very concept of the birth of a medium is problematic and paradoxical, at least if we consider birth as a unique and circumscribed event that punctuates the unfolding of history. Our task here is thus to propose a dynamic model that can contribute to our understanding of the genealogy of media.},

Godard's films show that the long take can be as abstract as a montage sequence, that realistic locations do not enhance realism, that the idea that film is the result of a purely mechanical process is questionable at best, and that a spatial continuum is not essential to the filmic representation of events.},

A new translation of Nancy's essay, 'The Image: Mimesis and Methexis', reveals how Nancy's work informs, challenges and inspires our encounters with visual culture. Jean-Luc Nancy is one of the most original and compelling of those contemporary political and ethical philosophers who, like Jacques Ranciere and Alain Badiou, have turned in recent works towards aesthetics and visual art. Nancy's challenging and inspiring writings on painting, film, photography, video and contemporary visual art have informed the work of scholars of visual culture and aesthetic theory as well as artists, filmmakers and curators"--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {This article examines the emergent field of media archaeology as offering a materialist approach to new media and specifically the Internet, constituting a `travelling discipline' or `indiscipline' rather than a new disciplinary paradigm. Following the lead of Siegfried Zielinski, it provides less an archaeology than an `anarchaeology' of media archaeology, understanding this term in political as well as methodological terms. To do so, it charts a trajectory through some of the sources of media archaeology and its key theoretical articulations in the work of Zielinski and Friedrich Kittler up to its more recent articulations in the work of Jussi Parikka and Wolfgang Ernst. It uses this theoretical trajectory to illuminate some of the key problematics of media archaeology, in terms of both its practical application as a form of `theoretical circuit breaking' and its most imaginative speculations as not only a material but even a geological approach to media as evident in Parikka's most recent work, by way of such phenomena as the `vernacular Web' and the problematics of e-waste. Throughout, it pays close attention to the value of media archaeology as a set of methods for new media research in relation to more established methodologies in media studies ranging from medium histories to cultural studies. In particular, it argues for articulating media archaeological approaches with media ecological ones, in order to bring out more clearly both the political stakes of the field and its potential contribution to studies of digital media.},

  abstract = {Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze are regarded as French ``Nietzscheans'' par excellence. By drawing attention to the articulation of ``difference'' in contemporary thought, this paper attempts to go beyond the label `Nietzschean' in an effort to discern two distinct philosophical trajectories inspired by Nietzsche. I suggest that Deleuze reads Nietzsche as an empiricist whose philosophy of nature critically undermines representational modes of thought from Plato to Hegel and beyond. Difference is therefore given in itself. Foucault, on the other hand, reads Nietzsche primarily as a historian of culture, whose radical reflection on language pushes philosophy into new interpretative forms of analysis that seriously confronts the role of political power in the production of truth. Difference is thus invented and only known within the contours of these fabrications. While no judgement is made about the accuracy or otherwise of their respective interpretations of Nietzsche, this paper implicitly asks whether a Nietzschean genealogical ethos can inform those political struggles today for which the meaning of difference is contested.},

But, today, we have become skeptical about the ability of an individual philosopher to engage in "universal thinking," so philosophy seems to capitulate in the face of cultural relativism. In Introduction to Antiphilosophy, Boris Groys argues that modern "antiphilosophy" does not pursue the universality of thought as its goal but proposes in its place the universality of life, material forces, social practices, passions, and experiences --angst, vitality, ecstasy, the gift, revolution, laughter or "profane illumination" --and he analyzes this shift from thought to life and action in the work of thinkers from Kierkegaard to Derrida, from Nietzsche to Benjamin. Ranging across the history of modern thought, Introduction to Antiphilosophy endeavors to liberate philosophy from the stereotypes that hinder its development. --Publisher},

Drawing on evolutionary biology, she explores the effect of time on the organization of matter and the development of biological life. She argues that factoring in the relentless forward movement of time throws new light on the ever-growing complication of social life, and also on political struggle." "Grosz juxtaposes the work of Darwin, Nietzsche and Bergson. Each theorises time as an active phenomenon with specific effects, with a profound impact on understandings of the body in relation to time. She shows how their concepts of life, evolution, and becoming are manifest in the work of Deleuze and Irigaray".--BOOKJACKET.},

This led to a simplification of cinema's ideological role as propping up the viewer's investment in a visual image as the product of a gaze.

  abstract = {In French, the words tasse 'teacup' and th\'ei\`ere 'teapot' also denote a public rest room where men have sex-a "tearoom" in English-and prendre le th\'e 'to have tea' means "to have homosexual sex." Most of the narrative of Marcel Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu is said to result from having tea with a madeleine. This essay examines the possibility that the passage in which Charlus engages in tearoom sex may imply that there are other such tea parties in the novel. More broadly, I consider the importance of coded or secret languages in the production of sexual knowledge. Revealing the tearoom's secret opens up a Trojan horse (to use Monique Wittig's term) of interpretive uncertainties in the novel, as well as a contagion of doubt concerning heterosexual masculinity and male subjectivity.},

  address = {{Albany}},
  abstract = {The publication in 1927 of Martin Heidegger's magnum opus, Being and Time, signaled an intellectual event of the first order and had an impact in fields far beyond that of philosophy proper. Being and Time has long been recognized as a landmark work of the twentieth century for its original analyses of the character of philosophic inquiry and the relation of the possibility of such inquiry to the human situation. Still provocative and much disputed, Heidegger's text has been taken as the inspiration for a variety of innovative movements in fields ranging from psychoanalysis, literary theory, existentialism, ethics, hermeneutics, and theology. A work that disturbs the traditions of philosophizing that it inherits, Being and Time raises questions about the end of philosophy and the possibilities for thinking liberated from the presumptions of metaphysics. The Stambaugh translation captures the vitality of the language and thinking animating Heidegger's original text. It is also the most comprehensive edition insofar as it includes the marginal notes made by Heidegger in his own copy of Being and Time, and takes account of the many changes that he made in the final German edition of 1976. The revisions to the original translation correct some ambiguities and problems that have become apparent since the translation appeared fifteen years ago. Bracketed German words have also been liberally inserted both to clarify and highlight words and connections that are difficult to translate, and to link this translation more closely to the German text},

Concluding the chapter is a discussion of the role of dialogue in sound films versus silent, which illustrates the advantages of employing different methods of computing average shot length comparatively.},

Moreover, identifying salient elements of cinematic machines for historical description requires a parallel investigation of the internal logic of the machine and its procedures at a given time, as well as the technical networks (historical, cultural, economic) to which they belong. Such histories must also include a rethinking of the technicity of gestures involved in the operation of film apparatuses.},

By charting the trade discourse, the text shows that American film theaters gradually adopted a two-projector system during the early to mid-1910s and thus screened multi-reel feature films without pauses. In contrast, Swedish film theaters retained the one-projector model with breaks well into the 1920s, and some did not switch over to two projectors until the breakthrough for sound. This non-uniformity for exhibition practices challenges notions about a hegemonic regime for audience absorption in the engagement with the story world. Breaks during projection clearly offset such a mindset and instead offered modes of intermittent and distracted engagement in fictions presented as recorded rather than just given.},

  abstract = {This essay revisits Raymond Williams's notion of `structures of feeling' with the intention of clarifying what Williams meant by `feelings', and of exploring the concept's possible range and reach within the study of culture. It recovers the initial anthropological context for the phrase by reconnecting it to the work of Ruth Benedict and Gregory Bateson. It goes on to suggest that while the analysis of `structures of feeling' has been deployed primarily in studies of literary and filmic culture it might be usefully extended towards the study of more ubiquitous forms of material culture such as clothing, housing, food, furnishings and other material practices of daily living. Indeed it might be one way of explaining how formations of feeling are disseminated, how they suture us to the social world and how feelings are embedded in the accoutrements of domestic, habitual life. The essay argues that by joining together a socially phenomenological interest in the world of things, accompanied by an attention to historically specific moods and atmospheres, `structures of feelings' can direct analyses towards important mundane cultural phenomena.},

@misc{hill_circular_1994,
  title = {Circular {{Breathing}}},
  author = {Hill, Gary},
  year = {1994},
  abstract = {The title of Circular Breathing comes from a technique that horn and reed instrument players use to play a continuous note, seemingly without taking a breath.  This notion is drawn upon with the visualization of long sequences composed of five discreet scenes that migrate onto the projection field with mathematical precision. Five large scale black-and-white projections (each 128 x 96 inches) oriented vertically and adjacent to one another, span a projection field of 40 feet from corner to corner.  The structure of Circular Breathing was derived from a segment in Hill's earlier installation, Between Cinema and a Hard Place, 1991.  As each of the five scenes/images sequentially switches from left to right onto the field, they in a sense share time.  The first scene slides out from the corner of the wall and at some point after becoming a full image begins to flicker with the addition of a second scene/image.  This flickering is the time being shared by the two scenes; since all five of these images emanate from a single source, only one can be on at a time.  Consequently, two scenes slow down to half speed; three screens to a third of the speed and so on.  Once the field of five scenes is complete, the images begin to approach photographic stillness.  The process then continues with the first scene (on the left) disappearing, thus making the remaining scenes gather speed.  The process continues until the fifth or last scene on the far right appears in real time.  It then slides off the wall seeming to disappear into the corner, and the process begins again with a new set of scenes.  In Circular Breathing, there is the sense of a disturbing narrative accumulating and dissipating through each successive set of scenes.  Images from the streets of Tangier, a ship on the open sea and the interior of a mosque juxtapose with a man chopping wood and a cigarette burning slowly in an ashtray.  An older woman reading and large thick hands loading a pistol unfold next to bladed stems and a close-up of an insect dragging its prey.  Throughout all the segments there is the recurring image of a woman's hands playing a piano.  The music, however, distorted by the changes of speed, can be identified as Vexations by Eric Satie.}

A 1995 documentary - Typically British: A Personal History of British Cinema by Stephen Frears - commissioned from one of the country's leading contemporary directors by the British Film Institute, to celebrate the centenary of cinema, straightforwardly concluded that 'To all intents and purposes there'd been no silent film industry in Britain'"--},

  abstract = {The components of the body displayed on sixteen monitors in this video installation are without any apparent distinction. They belong, however, to the artist. The arrangement of images on the monitors, which are of various sizes and stripped of their casings, does not follow the organization of the human body. Representations of Hill's ear and foot lie side by side; tucked modestly behind them is an image of his groin. Within this unassuming configuration, each raster invites meditation. For example, on one screen a thumb plays with the corner of a book page. By concentrating the viewer's attention on such a rudimentary activity, Hill causes the movement to take on the significance of a much larger event. The ceaselessness of the activity is an illusion in that each component exists only as a seamless loop lasting five to thirty seconds. Long, nervelike black wires attached to each monitor are bundled together like spinal cords. They snake along a shelf and disappear from view at the back of a recess. This electrical network emphasizes the presentation of body parts as extremities without a unifying torso. The hidden core to which the components of the body are attached serves as a metaphor for a human being's invisible, existential center: the soul. Reinforcing the living quality of the installation is its textured composition of ambient sound.}

Hiller has a special relationship to Matt's Gallery where her exhibition in 1980 was one of the gallery's first; in 1991 Matt's Gallery commissioned the video installation An Entertainment (the first synchronised multi-screen video work made in Europe); and in 2008, the first London showing of The Last Silent Movie took place at the Gallery.}

  abstract = {Discourse analysis has come to represent something of a `growth industry' in both research and critical psychology. Despite the apparent indebtedness of many such methods of discourse analysis to Foucault, there exists no strictly Foucauldian method of analysing discourse. Through a close reading of Foucault's `The order of discourse' (1981), this paper re-characterizes the concept of discourse from a firmly Foucauldian perspective. Whilst not arguing against discourse analysis per se, the author indirectly takes issue with erroneous (mis)-applications of Foucault's conceptualization by clarifying his perspective on what discourse is, and on what `discursive analysis' should entail. This critical presentation of the Foucauldian notion of the discursive will be contrasted with perhaps the two most prominent `schools' of discourse analysis in psychology, namely those of Parker (1992) and Potter \& Wetherell (1987). Key issues in this regard revolve around the themes of knowledge, materiality and history. By outlining the core components of what Foucault (1981) terms 'the order of discourse' and through the exposition of a four step 'method' of discursive critique, the author propounds an image of what a Foucauldian discursive analytic method may have looked like, should it have ever existed, before specifying exactly why one never did.},

He argues that these qualities exist independently of the discursive side of the process. This article explores the complicated dynamic between the material, `sticky' aspects of making and the various texts that were written alongside the making in my own Ph.D. How can the practical and written components work to support rather than usurp each other? I will argue that the relationship between theory (as written) and theory (as practice) forms concertina-like push-and-pull tensions that each inform the other. Using Pierre Bourdieu's concept of `habitus' the material, or `sticky', qualities of artworks may be seen to link to our bodily and haptic understanding of the world. This discussion has implications for anyone undertaking practice-based research who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of the theory-practice dynamic within it.},

The idea of the gesture in fine art, such as brushstrokes, signatures, and styles, indicates physically manifested artists' emotions, messages or states of mind. These would be read by the viewer in the resulting marks. In digital media, on the other hand, the presence of the artist is flattened and smoothed with the high fidelity quality of video on the seamless screen, but the traces behind the image remain as data and process logs. These digital traces, I believe, are not visually present in the forefront, as like a physical gesture, but tele-connected and tele-communicated through the processes of editing and collecting with various applications, in the digital environment of producing, viewing, and responding. For this project, I collected videos from the BT film archive that used old dial telephones and explain the way of use the new technology. Then, I experimented with developing a performative image-based video, which can be transformed through the reflective editing and archiving process. Through this process, the artist becomes a performer and self-spectator in the aspect of artistic gesture. Videos featuring hands manipulating the telephone  from the BT archive are edited into `gesture clips'. These are recreated in the image sequences by two orders: digital data and time. After that, the edited video is placed in a three-dimensional virtual space that triggers the spectators hands' or heads' interactive movement using the computer, smartphone or VR. Thereby, it not only allows the artist's process to become part of the project, but also connects three different gestures within the transformative moving image: imagery, artist, and viewer.},

  abstract = {Three resources have been developped over the ages to deal with agencies. The first one is to attribute to them naturality and to link them with nature. The second one is to grant them sociality and to tie them with the social fabric. The third one is to consider them as a semiotic construction and to relate agency with the building of meaning. The originality of science studies comes from the impossibility of clearly differentiating those three resources. Microbes, neutrinos of DNA are at the same time natural, social and discourse. They are real, human and semiotic entities in the same breath. The article explores the consequence of this peculiar situation which has not been underlined before science studies forced us to retie the links between these three resources. The actor-network theory developped by Callon and his colleagues is an attempt to invent a vocabulary to deal with this new situation. The article reviews those difficulties and tries ot overcome them by showing how they may be used to account for the consturction of entities, that is for the attribution of nature, society and meaning.},

It covers a broad range of magical, mystical and phenomenological interactions between the two media, from early film's eroticized tableaux vivants to enigmatic sculptures in modernist cinema. Sculptures are literally brought to life on the silver screen, while living people are turned into, or trapped inside, statuary. The book examines key sculptural motifs and cinematic sculpture in film history through a series of case studies and through an extensive reference gallery of 150 different films. Considering the work of directors like Georges Melies, Jean Cocteau and Alain Resnais, as well as films like House of Wax, Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans, this is an innovative exploration of two different media, their artistic traditions and their respective theoretical paradigms},

The masses subjected to the society of spectacle have traditionally been seen as aesthetically and politically passive - in response, both artists and thinkers have sought to transform the spectator into an active agent and the spectacle into a performance. In this follow-up to the acclaimed "The Future of the Image", Ranciere takes a radically different approach to this attempted emancipation. Beginning by asking exactly what we mean by political art or the politics of art, he goes on to look at what the tradition of critical art, and the desire to insert art into life, has achieved. Has the militant critique of the consumption of images and commodities become, instead, a melancholic affirmation of their omnipotence?},

Borrowing from Flaubert's notion of a dictionary of "received ideas" and Raymond Williams's explorations of the "keywords" of the modern age, Jay investigates some of the central concepts by which we currently organize our thoughts and lives. His topics range from "theory" and "experience" to the meaning of "multiculturalism" and the dynamics of cultural "subversion." Among the thinkers he engages are Bataille and Foucault, Adorno and Lacoue-Labarthe, Benjamin, Lyotard, and Christa Wolf." "By looking closely at what "words do and perform," Jay makes us aware of the extent to which the language we use mediates and shapes our experience. By helping to distance us from much that we now take for granted, he makes it difficult for us to remain comfortably certain about what we think we know."--Jacket.},

Editor Gabrielle Jennings--a video artist herself--reveals as never before how works of abstract video are not merely, as the renowned curator Kirk Varnedoe once put it, 'pictures of nothing,' but rather amorphous, ungovernable spaces that encourage contemplation and innovation. Featuring renowned artists such as Jeremy Blake, Mona Hatoum, Pierre Huyghe, Ryoji Ikeda, Takeshi Murata, Diana Thater and Jennifer West, alongside emerging artists, this volume offers fresh and vigorous perspectives on a burgeoning and ever-changing arena of contemporary art"--Provided by publisher},

A motiongram is a visual display of motion, based on frame differencing and reduction of a regular video recording. The resultant motiongram shows the spatial shape of the motion as it unfolds in time, somewhat similar to the way in which spectrograms visualise the shape of (musical) sound. The visual similarity of motiongrams and spectrograms is the conceptual starting point for the sonomotiongram technique, which explores how motiongrams can be turned into sound using ``inverse FFT''. The paper presents the idea of shape-sonification, gives an overview of the sonomotiongram technique, and discusses sonification examples of both simple and complex human motion.},

How does such a mode of ``art writing'' relate to oppositional strategies often employed by certain artists challenging the boundaries traditionally separating art from writing? What role does the body play in such a model of writing? What role might fiction play in an expressionist art criticism? The intended outcome is to render a new model of writing ``in the expanded field,'' to borrow Rosalind Krauss's phrase.},

This book is the first in English to focus on his last project, the encyclopedic Atlas of Images: Mnemosyne. Begun in earnest in 1927, and left unfinished at the time of Warburg's death in 1929, the Atlas consisted of sixty-three large wooden panels covered with black cloth. On these panels Warburg carefully, intuitively arranged some thousand black-and-white photographs of classical and Renaissance art objects, as well as of astrological and astronomical images ranging from ancient Babylon to Weimar Germany. Here and there, he also included maps, manuscript pages, and contemporary images taken from newspapers. Trying through these constellations of images to make visible the many polarities that fueled antiquity's afterlife, Warburg envisioned the Atlas as a vital form of metaphoric thought. While the nondiscursive, frequently digressive character of the Atlas complicates any linear narrative of its themes and contents, Christopher D. Johnson traces several thematic sequences in the panels. By drawing on Warburg's published and unpublished writings and by attending to Warburg's cardinal idea that "pathos formulas" structure the West's cultural memory, Johnson maps numerous tensions between word and image in the Atlas. In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of the Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, the Atlas is not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture."--Publisher's Web site},

  abstract = {"Helping Doctoral Students Write offers a proven approach to effective doctoral writing. By treating research as writing and writing as research, the authors offer pedagogical strategies for doctoral supervisors that will assist the production of well-argued and lively dissertations. It is clear that many doctoral candidates find research writing complicated and difficult, but the advice they receive often glosses over the complexities of writing and/or locates the problem in the writer. Kamler and Thomson provide a highly effective framework for scholarly work that is located in personal, institutional and cultural contexts. The pedagogical approach developed in the book is based on the notion of writing as a social practice. This approach allows supervisors to think of doctoral writers as novices who need to learn new ways with words as they enter the discursive practices of scholarly communities. This involves learning sophisticated writing practices with specific sets of conventions and textual characteristics. The authors offer supervisors practical advice on helping with commonly encountered writing tasks such as the proposal, the journal abstract, the literature review and constructing the dissertation argument. The first edition of this book has helped many academics and thousands of research students produce better written material. Now fully updated the second edition includes: Examples from a broader range of academic disciplines A new chapter on writing from the thesis More advice on reading and note taking, performance and conferences, Further information on developing a personal academic writing style, and Advice on the use of social media (blogs, tweets and wikis) to create trans-disciplinary and trans-national networks and conversations"--},

His work not only forms the crux of the debates of his time, but also remains key to understanding later developments in film practice and theory. Epstein's film criticism is among the most wide-ranging, provocative and poetic writing about cinema and his often breathtaking films offer insights into cinema and the experience of modernity. This collection - the first comprehensive study in English of Epstein's far-reaching influence - arrives as several of the concerns most central to Epstein's work are being reexamined, including theories of perception, realism, and the relationship between cinema and other arts. The volume also includes new translations from every major theoretical work Epstein published, presenting the widest possible historical and contextual range of Epstein's work, from his beginnings as a biology student and literary critic to his late film projects and posthumously published writings"--P.

  abstract = {Although scholarship in the social construction of technology (SCOT) has contributed much to illuminating technological development, most work using this theoretical approach is committed to an agency-centered approach. SCOT scholars have made only limited contributions to illustrating the influence of social structures. In this article, the authors argue for the importance of structural concepts to understanding technological development. They summarize the SCOT conceptual framework defined by Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker and survey some of the methodological and explanatory difficulties that arise with their approach. Then the authors present concepts from organizational sociology and political economy that illuminate structural influences in shaping phenomena of interest to SCOT scholars. These structural concepts can be applied to the study of the design, development, and transformation of technology. The authors conclude that the limited amount of scholarship on structural factors in the social shaping of technological development presents numerous opportunities for research.},

  abstract = {"The Altering Eye covers a "golden age" of international cinema from the end of WWII through to the New German Cinema of the 1970s. Combining historical, political, and textual analysis, Kolker develops a pattern of cinematic invention and experimentation from neorealism through the modernist interventions of Jean-Luc Godard and Rainer Maria Fassbinder, focusing along the way on such major figures as Luis Bu\~nuel, Joseph Losey, the Brazilian director Glauber Rocha, and the work of major Cuban filmmakers. Kolker's book has become a much quoted classic in the field of film studies providing essential reading for anybody interested in understanding the history of European and international cinema. This new and revised edition includes a substantive new preface by the author and an updated bibliography."--Publisher's website.},

  abstract = {장소 특정적 미술이 60년대 후반에 등장한 이래로 `장소'의 개념은 미학적 전위주의와 정치적 진보주의의 수사를 수반하면서 단계적인 변화를 겪어왔다. 이 책은 시공간의 경험이 동질화되고 있는 후기자본주의 사회에서 지역적 특수성이 소멸되고, 지리적 위치에 기반을 둔 개인의 정체성이 흔들리는 현대사회의 불안을 장소 특정적 미술을 통해 이론화하고 있다. 저자는 고정된 장소에 대한 향수와 노마딕한 유동성에의 매혹 사이에서 부유하는 장소 특정적 미술의 분석을 통해 현대미술의 비판적 가능성을 타진하고 나아가 주체의 형성과 공간의 관계라는 광범위한 철학적 문제에 접근하고 있으며, 이러한 문제는 현재에도 여전히 중요한 과제로 남아 있다고 주장한다.},

Deleuze focuses equilibrium conditions since it is only in these "phase spaces" (as he calls them in Difference and Repetition) that difference-driven morphogenesis comes into its o matter becomes an active material agent which does not need form to impose itself the outside. The process behind this formation is a double movement of sorting a tion. The essay maps this diagrammatic operation described by Deleuze onto the f ety, geology and evolution.},

Today, in a world of rapid diagnoses, quick cures, and big pharmaceutical dollars, the catch-all concept of depression has evolved to take their place. Here, Darian Leader argues that this shift is more than semantic; rather, it speaks to our culture's complicated relationship with loss, suffering, and grief. Part memoir, part cultural analysis, Leader draws on examples from literature, art, cinema, and history, as well as case studies from his work as a psychologist, to explore the unconscious ways our culture responds to the experience of loss, providing an innovative tour of mourning and melancholia and our culture's struggle to understand them.--From publisher description},

Recounted through the author's positionality as an Asian American feminist academic, the article describes her encounters in the university and the street, in the United States and China. Addressing gestures of face touching and the trope of the mask relative to its wearer, the essay draws on the work of Mel Y. Chen on the viral conjunction of race, animality, illness, and gender as inflected further by both historical and contemporary treatments of ``Chineseness'' and visibility. In so doing, the article reframes concepts of perfomativity and the face that are associated with Judith Butler, with the face becoming ``the fallen site of discourse'' under the conditions of a pandemic.},

  abstract = {본 논문은 들뢰즈의 저작 『감각의 논리』에서 제시되는 다이어그램(diagramme) 개념을 분석함으로써, 다이어그램 개념이 회화 요소의 이분법적인 구분을 극복할 수 있는 길을 제시하고, 모더니즘 회화를 보는 새로운 시각을 제시하였음을 밝힌다. 본고는 들뢰즈의 철학 내에서 다이어그램이 갖는 세 가지 의의에 주목한다. 첫째, 다이어그램은 ``힘 관계의 지도''로 재정의됨으로써 현실을 구축하는 가장 근본적인 차원을 가리키게 된다. 둘째, 다이어그램은 일상의 사고에 내재된 기표-기의 관계에 '앞서는' 차원을 가리킨다. 셋째, 다이어그램은 비담론적인 형태와 담론적인 형태의 공통 원인으로 작용하는데, 이를 통해 비담론적인 형태의 중요성을 제고하는 동시에 둘 사이의 환원불가능성을 설명할 수 있게 된다. 이는 들뢰즈가 푸코의 『감시와 처벌』을 18세기의 감금시설에 대한 분석에 그치는 저작이 아니라, 보편적인 적용 가능성을 가진 하나의 철학적인 저작으로 보고 적극적으로 독해하는 데서 출발한다. 다이어그램 개념은 사회적 장에 적용됨으로써 비담론적인 형태의 존재를 확언하는 동시에 비담론적인 형태와 담론적인 형태의 상호 침투를 가능하게 한다. 이와 유사하게, 회화의 다이어그램은 기존의 회화와 이론에서 경시되었던 손적인 것의 중요성을 드높인다. 동시에 기존의 미술사에서 설정한, 시각적인 것과 손적인 것 간의 길항관계를 극복하는 역할을 한다. 이러한 한계를 극복하는 회화로, 들뢰즈는 손적인 것과 시각적인 것을 융합하는 제 3의 길인 '형상(Figure)'을 제시한다. 형상은 전통적인 재현회화나 구상회화가 갖는 촉각적 지시대상과는 구분되며, 원본과 감각적인 닮음 관계에 놓인다. 베이컨 회화가 구현하는 형상에서 시각적인 것과 손적인 것은 구상회화와 추상회화, 추상표현주의 회화에서와 달리 상호 침투적인 관계를 갖는데, 이 양자의 상호 침투를 가능하게 하는 것이 바로 다이어그램이다. 회화에 적용된 다이어그램은 다음과 같은 역할을 한다. 첫 번째로, 화가의 신체적인 행위를 통해 만들어지는 회화의 다이어그램은 화폭에 힘을 직접적으로 개입시키는 역할을 함으로써 화폭 위에 감각이 구현되는 바탕을 마련한다. 다이어그램은 화가가 시각의 개입 없이 무작위적으로 던진 물감이나 화폭을 빗자루 등의 도구로 쓸어낸 자국을 가리킨다. 이렇게 손적인 것, 즉 화가의 신체가 직접적으로 가하는 힘을 통해 만들어진 다이어그램은 특정한 방식으로 작동하는 ``특질들과 얼룩들, 선들, 지대들의 집합체''로 정의된다. 두 번째로, 이렇게 만들어진 다이어그램은 회화의 제작과정에 내재하여 있는 기표-기의 관계에서 벗어나 그에 앞서 있는 탈의미작용적 영역을 개입시키는 역할을 한다. 들뢰즈가 보기에 구상성을 피하고자 손적인 것의 개입을 최소한으로 축소한 추상회화는 일종의 상징적 약호(code)를 만든다. 한편 잭슨 폴록의 회화로 대표되는 추상표현주의 회화는 화폭에 손적인 것만을 남김으로써 회화의 과정에 시각적인 것의 개입을 거의 불가능하게 한다. 모더니즘 회화들은 이와 같이 기존의 재현과 추상의 대립구도 하에 촉각적 지시대상의 부정에만 주목하여 다시금 기표와 기의의 관계에 갇혔다. 한편 베이컨의 회화는 탈의미작용적인 다이어그램을 통해 기표와 기의의 관계가 해체된 캔버스 위에서 출발함으로써 감각을 다루는 회화 본연의 역할을 하게 된다. 다이어그램은 흰 캔버스를 앞에 두고 화가의 머릿속에 자리 잡은 구상적 소여, 즉 이미지를 제거하는 역할을 한다. 구상적 소여는 화가가 일상을 살면서 접한 사진, 삽화 등의 이미지들이며, 아무것도 없는 흰 캔버스를 마주하고 있을지라도 이러한 이미지들에 의해 화가는 영향을 받고, 그것에 얽매일 수 있다. 우연한 표시인 다이어그램은 흰 캔버스 위에 예측할 수 없는 형태를 만들어 놓음으로써 이러한 이미지를 제거하는 역할을 하며, 이것이 다이어그램이 일차적으로 구상성을 제거하는 방식이다. 세 번째로, 다이어그램은 손적인 것과 시각적인 것의 양립을 가능하게 한다. 앞서 보았듯 다이어그램은 무엇을 재현하거나 그려내고자 하는 의도가 개입하지 않은 채로 손을 통해 우연적인 자국을 남기는 것이다. 다이어그램을 바탕으로 하여 화가의 이차적 구상작용이 일어나는데, 이 최종적인 과정을 통해 손적인 것과 시각적인 것의 상호 침투가 가능해진다. 이 마지막 단계를 통해 ``사실의 가능성''에 불과했던 다이어그램은 이로부터 들뢰즈가 ``회화적 사실''이라 부르는 것을 구현한다. 회화적 사실이라는 표현은 회화가 힘을 담음으로써 현재적으로 존재하고, 나아가 하나의 `사실'로서 존재함을 의미한다. 이러한 회화적 사실은 서술적이거나 삽화적, 구상적인 이미지를 담은 재현회화나 시각적인 것만을 중시하는 추상회화로부터는 탄생하지 않으며, 힘을 배당하는 다이어그램의 작용을 통해 보이지 않는 힘을 포착한 회화를 통해서만 가능하다. 본 논문은 회화에서 다이어그램의 역할이 들뢰즈의 이전 저작 『푸코』와 『천 개의 고원』에서 드러나는 다이어그램의 기능적 측면을 회화에 적용하여 해석함으로써 보다 명료하게 드러남을 밝혔다. 『감각의 논리』에 등장하는 다이어그램은 화폭에 힘을 분배하고, 그 자체로는 어떠한 의미작용도 하지 않으면서 동시에 다른 형식들 간의 상호 침투를 가능하게 하는 바탕의 역할을 한다. 다이어그램 개념은 본래 사회적 장에 대한 고찰에서 출발하였지만, 회화에 적용됨으로써 기존의 회화와 당대의 이론이 마주하였던 `시각성'이라는 보이지 않는 장벽을 가시화하고 극복하는 역할을 한다. 나아가, 회화의 다이어그램은 회화적 사실을 구축함으로서, 감각의 구현이라는 회화의 목적에 있어 핵심적인 역할을 한다. 결론적으로, 본 연구는 들뢰즈가 『감각의 논리』에서 다이어그램 개념을 통해 회화 요소의 이분법적인 구분을 극복할 수 있는 길을 제시하고, 모더니즘 회화를 보는 새로운 시각을 제안하였음을 보다 명료하게 밝히고자 하였다.},

In short, Metz was frequently attacked for being indiffferent to fijilm as an aesthetic artefact. This chapter seeks to develop a more nuanced view by examining the place that the aesthetic occupies in Metz's intellectual trajectory as well as its links with semiology. This place can be divided, broadly speaking at least, into three `sites' between which the aesthetic moves: expressiveness, stylistics, and poetics.},

I would like to suggest that the two be thought of dialectically, both as concepts and as actually-existing things in the world. After outlining my use to date of these concepts, and their deployment in my research into colonial India, I will counterpoise Giorgio Agamben's and Giles Deleuze's reflections on Michel FoucauIt's use of the term dispositif/apparatus. Deleuze's obvious and acknowledged indebtedness to Foucault's work, but his explicit re-rendering of the Foucauldian interest in order with the Deleuzian conceptualisation of dis-order, will be used to conclude with some methodological suggestions regarding how Deleuze and Foucault, agencement and dispositif, assemblages and apparatuses, can and should be thought together.},

  abstract = {Computer vision" refers to a broad class of algorithms that allow computers to make intelligent assertions about digital images and video. Historically, the creation of computer vision systems has been regarded as the exclusive domain of expert researchers and engineers in the fields of signal processing and artificial intelligence. Likewise, the scope of application development for computer vision technologies, perhaps constrained by conventional structures for research funding, has generally been limited to military and law\-enforcement purposes. Recently, however, improvements in software development tools for student programmers and interactive\-media artists \textemdash{} in combination with the rapid growth of open\-source code\-sharing communities, predictable increases in PC processor speeds, and plummeting costs of digital video hardware \textemdash{} have made widespread artistic experimentation with computer vision techniques a reality. The result is a proliferation of new practitioners with an abundance of new application ideas, and the incorporation of computer vision techniques into the design vocabularies of novel artworks, games, home automation systems, and other areas. This article attempts to demystify computer vision for novice programmers, through a survey of new applications in the arts, system design considerations, and contemporary tools.},

  abstract = {Towards a Political Aesthetics of Cinema: The Outside of Film is a contribution to an aesthetics of cinema rooted in Marxist theory. Rather than focusing on the role that certain films, or the cinema as an institution, might play in political consciousness, the book asks a different question: how can the subject of politics in film be thought? This problem is presented in a systematic-theoretical rather than historical manner. The main aim of this book is a retrospective rehabilitation of the psychoanalytical concept of "suture," whose political core is progressively revealed. In a second step, this rereading of "suture"-theory is mediated with the Marxist aesthetics of Fredric Jameson. From the perspective of this reconfigured aesthetics of negativity, films by Hitchcock, Antonioni, Haneke and Kubrick are analyzed as articulations of a political unconscious.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a direction\textemdash inspired by a reading of Heidegger's reflections on sculpture\textemdash in which thinking enriched by artistic experience can unfold an alternative mode of being-in-the-world. Heidegger points out that, in contrast to a scientific understanding of space as an empty container, the special character of space in sculpture is characterized by a clearing-away (R\"aumen), which presupposes and points to an open, receptive attitude toward experience that is necessary for dwelling to take place. From Heidegger this article proceeds to reflect on artworks by Eduardo Chillida and Janet Echelman. These offer concrete examples of how a thinking of sculpture can apply to different notions of place. While Chillida's sculptures present a sense of place as rooted and embedded in the landscape, Echelman's artworks explore an expanded notion of place through a multisensory sense of immersion. Applying Heidegger's meditations on R\"aumen, it turns out that the differences between these artworks are of greatest significance in illustrating the breadth of the experiential space that they share: an openness to dwelling and a receptivity toward being-in-the-world. In this way, Heidegger's reflections on sculpture are unfolded in a contemporary context and the potential of sculpture for a thinking of experience is established.},

  abstract = {In his essay The Origin of the Work of Art, Martin Heidegger discusses three examples of artworks: a painting by Van Gogh of peasant shoes, a poem about a Roman fountain, and a Greek temple. The new entry on Heidegger's aesthetics in the Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy, written by Iain Thomson, focuses on this essay, and Van Gogh's painting in particular. It argues that Heidegger uses Van Gogh's painting to set art, as the happening of truth, in relation to `nothing', which is a key term in Heidegger's essays leading up to The Origin of the Work of Art. This paper extends a similar analysis to the Greek temple as a way of offering an exposition of Heidegger's concerns in the essay. It begins by briefly outlining Thomson's argument that Heidegger relates Van Gogh's painting to `nothing', and indicating the way this argument can be extended to the Greek temple. It then discusses three ways in which `nothing' can open up the significance of the temple as a work of art in which truth happens: (1) it is not concerned with objective representation; (2) it depicts the primal strife of earth and world, concealing and unconcealing; (3) it is fundamentally historical.},

  abstract = {In this article I will reassess the ideas of artist, intellectual and educator Peter Gidal, who, unlike his similarly positioned contemporaries Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, is not well remembered today outside avant-garde film histories and readerships. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in a series of publications through the BFI press, in more artists' film-focused journals such as Afterimage and Undercut, and, most significantly in the then leading film theory journal Screen, Gidal argued the centrality of the avant-garde, especially a local British expression he termed `structural/materialist' film. Drawing on previous studies of Gidal by Deke Dusinberre (1976) and D. N. Rodowick (1988), and also the study of intellectual, literary and artistic fields by Pierre Bourdieu (1993), I propose, notwithstanding the lack of current interest in screen studies in the avant-garde and its association with the `teleologies of negation' (James Donald 1989), a reappraisal of the significance and relevance of Gidal's contribution to the theorization and practice of cinema in higher education. I will contest the historical reputation of Gidal and to some extent his own presentation of himself as an outsider (2006) with the argument that he simultaneously challenged and developed ideas central to screen studies to their most extreme and difficult conclusion. Gidal's enduring influence on artists' film in Britain has been acknowledged, but his contribution to screen theory is much less widely known, and the productive potential of his ideas not well understood or pursued.},

  abstract = {Static is a digital projection on a seven-minute loop that was shot on 35mm film and transferred to video. The piece has sound and was produced in an edition of four plus one artist's proof. Tate's copy is number four in the edition. In the film, the camera ceaselessly circles around the Statue of Liberty in New York, alternating between distance shots that show the monument looming over docks and buildings, and compelling close-ups that seem to capture every detail, from the torch held aloft, to an arm clutching the tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law), to the statue's serene unfocussed glance. The film was shot from a helicopter, whose relentless whirr fades in and out on the sound track, adding a sense of discontinuity that is reinforced by the contrasting speeds at which foreground and background move in front of the viewer. The title of the film suggests a fixed perspective and a lack of movement and development, in contrast to the perpetual movement of the camera. Circling around the static monument, the different sections of the New York and New Jersey skyline are described by a continually changing perspective. This relentless circular motion around the monument and the proximity of the statue present an alternative view of the landmark, an icon of freedom whose legend reads `The Statue of Liberty: Liberty Enlightening the World'. Through its close scrutiny, Static calls into question the monument's ability to maintain these values unscathed. The film was made in 2009, the same year that President Barack Obama's Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, announced that as a `special gift' to America, the statue would reopen to the public from 4 July (American Independence day), having been closed following the attacks of 11 September 2001.}

In addition, the new edition expands and updates the discussion of theoretical concepts and ideas which underpin contemporary artists' video. Tracking the changing forms of video art in relation to the revolution in electronic and digital imaging that has taken place during the last 50 years, A History of Video Art orients video art in the wider art historical context, with particular reference to the shift from the structuralism of the late 1960s and early 1970s to the post-modernist concerns of the 1980s and early 1990s. The new edition also explores the implications of the internationalisation of artists' video in the period leading up to the new millennium and its concerns and preoccupations including post-colonialism, the post-medium condition and the impact and influence of the internet"--},

The computer screen should function as an Albertian window: a flat surface through which to behold simulated, virtual spaces.

The transformation from Sutherland's seemingly audacious proposition to develop{$<$}em{$>$}virtual{$<$}/em{$>$}screen-based environments to the acknowledgment of computer-mediated telepresence and teleaction between{$<$}em{$>$}actual{$<$}/em{$>$}environments is a dramatic one.{$^1$} Both thinkers' remarks,},

By claiming to offer a mechanism to translate every conceivable occurrence into an abstract code that can be endlessly manipulated, digitally processed data has caused conventional reference systems which hinge on our ability to mark points of origin, to rapidly implode. Authors from a range of disciplines provide insights into such a political economy of data capitalism; the political possibilities of techno-logics beyond data appropriation and data refusal; questions of visual, spatial and geographical organization; emergent ways of life and the environments that sustain them; and the current challenges of data publics, which is explored via case studies of three of the most influential platforms in the social media economy today: Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp. Data Publics will be of great interest to academics and students in the fields of computer science, philosophy, sociology, media and communication studies, architecture, visual culture, art and design, and urban and cultural studies"--},

  author = {Mullarkey, John},
  year = {2009},
  publisher = {{Palgrave Macmillan}},
  address = {{Basingstoke}},
  abstract = {Why is film becoming increasingly important to philosophers? Is it because it can be a helpful tool in teaching philosophy, in illustrating it? Or is it because film can also think for itself, can create its own philosophy? Indeed, many film-philosophers claim that film does more than merely illustrate philosophical texts: rather, film itself can philosophise in direct audio-visual terms. Too often, however, when philosophers claim to find indigenous philosophical value in cinema, it is only on account of refracting it through their own thought: film philosophises because it accords with a favoured kind of extant philosophy. Refractions of Reality: Philosophy and the Moving Image is the first book to examine all the central issues surrounding the vexed relationship between the film-image and philosophy. In it, John Mullarkey tackles the work of particular philosophers and theorists (Zizek, Deleuze, Cavell, Bordwell, Badiou, Branigan, Ranc\"ire, Frampton, and many others) as well as general philosophical positions (Analytical and Continental, Cognitivist and Culturalist, Psychoanalytic and Phenomenological). Moreover, it also offers an incisive analysis and explanation of several prominent forms of film theorising, providing a meta-logical account of their mutual advantages and deficiencies that will prove immensely useful to anyone interested in the details of particular theories of film presently circulating, as well as correcting, revising, and re-visioning the field of film theory as a whole. Throughout, Mullarkey asks whether the reduction of film to text is unavoidable. In particular: must philosophy (and theory) always transform film into pre-texts for illustration? What would it take to imagine how film might itself theorise without reducing it to standard forms of thought and philosophy? Finally, and fundamentally, must we change our definition of philosophy and even of thought itself in order to accommodate the speci?cities that come with the claim that film can produce philosophical theory?--R\'esum\'e de l'\'editeur.},

  pages = {24},
  abstract = {This paper approaches the concept of intermediality as a form of operation, as work in progress. A historiography of intermedia processes, including so called new or digital media would have to unfold in a specific social and historical context. On the one hand, it is closely linked to particular artistic, material, media-related and communicative forms of action; on the other hand, it should always be seen in the context of production of meanings that grow from these actions for a particular historical audience or historical users. In short: intermediality is closely intertwined with particular social and institutional practices. Intermedia research is not that new as we might suppose. Following that statement this article presents a short retrospective of the concept of intermediality, of the axe de pertinence interm\'ediatique, where its interactions, overlaps and differences with regard to the notions of intertextuality, hybridity and interartiality are re-constructed and the options or advantages of an intermedia historiography are clarified. An archaeology of intermedia processes should not be reduced to a monolithic paradigm of ``materialities'' or ``meanings,'' but should rather guide us toward new degrees of complexity in the research of intermediality in the digital era.},

A phenomenological perspective is adopted to explore user embodiment in those virtual reality applications that both do and do not include a visual body (re)presentation (virtual body). Embodiment is viewed from the perspective of sensorial immersion, where issues of gender, race, and culture are all implicated. Accounts of "disrupted" bodies (for example, phantom limb and dissociation of the self from the body, paralysis, and objectified bodies) are advanced in order to provide a context for understanding the ways in which embodiment in virtual reality environments may be instantiated. The explicit claim that virtual reality is an embodied experience and can facilitate the radical transfiguration of the body and its sensorial architecture is explored and evaluated.},

The structure was dictated by the process and goal of catching a fish: When the fish was caught the film was over. What we don't know is what would have happened had the fish not been caught. Part tongue-in-cheek instructional film, Fishing is also an allegory for the unpredictable nature of artmaking. As with Beckett's Molloy, who transferred a stone from one pocket to another,},

If you'd like to help create subs for other languages, then contact me. [Dutch \&amp; Portuguese below] Excerpts from the historical debate between Michel Foucault and Noam Chomsky have passed the reverse many times in recent years. And there is frequently referred to these two thinkers. Here we will be showing the whole fascinating debate on philosophy and politics that in 1971 was recorded for Dutch television. Noam Chomsky (1928): linguist, historian, philosopher, critic and political activist. As the "father of modern linguistics" (linguistics), he focused on the issue of innate vs.. the learned. In his later career has evolved as a major critic of foreign policy of the United States (from Vietnam to South America to the Middle East) and propaganda in the modern media with one of his major works "Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media". Michel Foucault (1926 - 1984): French philosopher, social theorist, historian and literary critic. In his work he researches power and its workings, how it influenced knowledge and how it is used as a form of social control. He is best known for his critical studies of social institutions such as psychiatry, social anthropology, the prison system and the history of human sexuality. One of his major works is "The Birth of the Prison, Discipline and Punish" (Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison) on changes in the criminal model of punishing the body (corporal punishment) to punish the spirit. This video contains the complete TV-Breadcast. Subtitles to be downloaded from: http://www.anarchistischegroepnijmege... ------ Het volledige televisiedebat tussen Michel Foucault en Noam Chomsky over de vraag van de menselijke natuur. Fragmenten uit het historische debat tussen Michel Foucault en Noam Chomsky zijn de nodige keren de revue gepasseerd de afgelopen jaren. En er wordt regelmatig aan deze twee denkers gerefereerd. Hier zullen we het gehele fascinerend debat over filosofie en politiek vertonen dat in 1971 werd opgenomen voor de Nederlandse televisie. Noam Chomsky (1928): lingu\"ist, historicus, filosoof, politiek criticus en activist. Als de 'vader van de moderne lingu\"istiek' (taalkunde) richtte hij zich op het vraagstuk van het aangeborene vs. het aangeleerde. In zijn latere carri\`ere heeft zich verder ontwikkeld als een belangrijke criticus van buitenlands beleid van de Verenigde Staten (van Vietnam tot Zuid-Amerika en het Midden-Oosten) en propaganda in de moderne media met als een van zijn belangrijkste werken "Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media". Michel Foucault (1926 -- 1984 ): Franse filosoof, sociaal theoreticus, historicus en literair criticus. In zijn werk behandeld hij was macht is en hoe dit werkt, de manier waarop het kennis be\"invloed en hoe het gebruikt wordt als een vorm van sociale controle. Hij is het meest bekend van zijn kritische studies van sociale instituten als de psychiatrie, sociale antropologie, het gevangenissysteem en de geschiedenis van de menselijke seksualiteit. Een van zijn belangrijke werken is "Naissance de la prison, Surveiller et punir" (Discipline, toezicht en straf: de geboorte van de gevangenis) over de veranderingen in het strafmodel van het straffen van het lichaam (lijfstraffen) naar straffen van de geest.

The questions considered are: Why do Gilles Deleuze and Gaston Bachelard develop radically different philosophical dialectics in relation to science? What is the significance of this difference for current approaches to Deleuze and science, most notably as developed by Manuel DeLanda? It is argued that, despite its great explanatory power, DeLanda's association of Deleuze with a particular set of contemporary scientific theories does not allow for the ontological openness and for the metaphysical sources of Deleuze's work. The argument turns on whether terms such as 'intensity* can be given predominandy scientific definitions or whether metaphysical definitions are more consistent with a sceptical relation of philosophy to contemporary science.},

  abstract = {Exhibition. Feb~8\textendash Nov~2, 2014. A World of Its Own: Photographic Practices in the Studio examines the ways in which photographers and other artists using photography have worked and experimented within their studios, from photography's inception to the present. Featuring both new acquisitions and works from the Museum's collection that have not been on view in recent years, A World of Its Own brings together photographs, films, and videos by artists such as Berenice Abbott, Uta Barth, Zeke Berman, Karl Blossfeldt, Constantin Brancusi, Geta Br\u{a}tescu, Harry Callahan, Robert Frank, Jan Groover, Barbara Kasten, Man Ray, Bruce Nauman, Paul Outerbridge, Irving Penn, Adrian Piper, Edward Steichen, William Wegman, and Edward Weston. Depending on the period, the cultural or political context, and the commercial, artistic, or scientific motivations of the artist, the studio might be a haven, a stage, a laboratory, or a playground. For more than a century, photographers have dealt with the spaces of their studios in strikingly diverse and inventive ways: from using composed theatrical tableaux (in photographs by Julia Margaret Cameron or Cindy Sherman) to putting their subjects against neutral backdrops (Richard Avedon, Robert Mapplethorpe); from the construction of architectural sets within the studio (Francis Brugui\`ere, Thomas Demand) to chemical procedures conducted within the darkroom (Walead Beshty, Christian Marclay); and from precise recordings of motion (Eadweard Muybridge, Harold Edgerton) to playful, amateurish experimentation (Roman Signer, Peter Fischli and David Weiss). A World of Its Own offers another history of photography\textemdash a photography created within the walls of the studio, and yet as innovative as its more extroverted counterpart, street photography.},

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

The examples discussed are modernist in orientation, and each has a particular association with a city*its history, architecture, and cultural character. Although it is common practice to refer to various*especially, modernist*framing situations as instances of deframing, the essay also enquires into the problematic nature of this term, suggesting alternative visual and cinematographic contexts more amenable to the deconstructive implications of this term. As the boundaries between cinema and the other arts continue to converge and relations between frame, image, and screen become more complex, this essay offers a reassessment of some first principles of film language, especially the aesthetic integrity of the cinematographic frame.},

  abstract = {This paper charts the course of Deleuze and Foucault's philosophical friendship or `block of becoming,' showing the series of reciprocal determinations through which each philosopher's thought develops in response to the other's. Specifically, I will argue that the concept of transversal resistance is fundamental for the political thought of both Foucault and Deleuze, allowing us to reconstruct the basis and trajectory of a shared political theory. This concept emerges in Deleuze and Guattari's schizo-politics, which advances the central aim of Foucault's earlier History of Madness (problematizing the exclusion of a certain intensive experience of madness; activating its potentially liberatory force) while accounting for why Foucault's particular politics of literary transgression had failed (the becoming-commodity of art). The question then becomes one of conceiving and creating transversal forms of struggle that would respond to the problem of capitalism\textemdash a question which Deleuze poses to Foucault, and which prompts and orients the latter's micro-political analytic of power. In turn, Foucault's analysis of the anti-transversal operation and economico-political function of power provides the critical groundwork for a theory of transversal politics. Such an affirmative project takes form in Foucault's late ethico-politics.},

The most famous 18th-century copper engraver, Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720 1778) made his name with etchings of ancient Rome. His startling, chiaroscuro images imbued the city's archaeological ruins with drama and romance and became favorite souvenirs for the Grand Tourists who travelled Italy in pursuit of classical culture and education. Today, Piranesi is renowned not just for shaping the European imagination of Rome but also for his elaborate series of fanciful prisons Carceri d'Invenzione, which have influenced generations of creatives since, from the Surrealists to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Edgar Allen Poe, Jorge Luis Borges and Franz Kafka. Loosely based on contemporary stage sets rather than the actual dingy dungeons of Piranesi's day, these intricate images defy architectural reality to play instead with perspective, lighting, and scale},

We show how typography, like prosody in spoken language, can be used intentionally to guide a reader's interpretation. We discuss a range of examples to show how typographical features are interpreted relative to the rest of the text and relative to the cultural norms and expectations associated with a particular language and writing system.},

  abstract = {"It was this volume that won the Prix Goncourt in 1919, affirming Proust as a major literary figure and dramatically increasing his fame. Here the narrator whose childhood was reflected in Swann's Way moves further through childhood and into adolescence, as the author brilliantly examines themes of love and youth, in settings in Paris and by the sea in Normandy. The reader again encounters Swann, now married to his former mistress and largely fallen from high society, and meets for the first time several of Proust's most memorable characters: the handsome, dashing Robert de Saint-Loup, who will become the narrator's best friend; the enigmatic Albertine, leader of the "little band" of adolescent girls; the profoundly artistic Elstir, believed to be Proust's composite of Whistler, Monet, and other leading painters; and, making his unforgettable entrance near the end of the volume, the intense, indelible Baron de Charlus. Permeated by the "bloom of youth" and its resonances in memories of love and friendship, In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower takes readers into the heart of Proust's comic and poetic genius. As with Swann's Way, Carter uses C. K. Scott Moncrieff's beloved translation as the basis for this annotated and fully revised edition. Carter corrects long-standing errors in Scott Moncrieff's otherwise superlative translation, bringing it closer than ever to the spirit and style of Proust's original text--and reaching English readers in a way that the Pl\'eiade annotations cannot. Insightful and accessible, Carter's edition of Marcel Proust's masterwork will be the go-to text for generations of readers seeking to understand Proust's remarkable bygone world." --},

  abstract = {The phrase `writing up' is often framed as the point where a research project is nearing its end, with only a summarizing thesis between a student and their completion. This text seeks to interrogate this dichotomy between research practice and writing. Instead, the text engenders reflective writing as a constant undercurrent of dialogue that continually shapes research through reflective thought. The text implements concepts from two key texts to meet these ends: Kamler and Thompson's               Helping Doctoral Students Write: Pedagogies for Supervision               and Bolt and Barrett's               Practice as Research: Approaches to Creative Arts Enquiry               . The first of the texts problematizes the notion of a formal `writing up' stage often cited by students and supervisors in research study, arguing instead for a shift towards a more dynamic role for writing in research, or indeed writing               as               research. The second of the contributing texts presents Barbara Bolt's notion of the `exegesis' as ancillary to this thought \textendash{} outlining written practice in arts research as an intrinsic, generative process, married to any practical outcome. Using the rhetoric outlined in these two references, this article then summarizes with an application of the notion of the `exegesis' to an assortment of personal written texts, such as reflective journal entries and assessed written works across three years of postgraduate study. Herein lies the key claim of this article \textendash{} that exegesis permeates every meaningful or developmental step of practice-led research, forming a crucial reciprocal relationship between visual and written work not unlike other hybridized methodologies outlined by authors such as Mieke Bal in her text,               Travelling Concepts in the Humanities: A Rough Guide               .},

  abstract = {This volume offers a succinct and clear account of the evolution of the work of noted French scholar Raymond Bellour (b. 1939) as expressed in his most important publications in the areas of cinema studies and art theory, published over the last four decades of the twentieth century and the first decades of the twenty-first. A film scholar and theorist, his interests ranged across film, literature, art and philosophy The book's first four chapters (Part 1 of the volume) provide a synthetic account of Bellour's thought on cinema and its relations to the development of moving-image installation art. Chapter one covers his perspectives on film analysis; chapter two continues with his views on the advent of digital media, including video; chapter three follows with his ideas about new forms of spectatorship, the body and classical cinema; chapter four concludes with his contribution to the debates about the end of cinema and the evolving               dispositifs               (situations or set-ups and their consequent viewing conventions) that have produced contemporary moving-image installation art. A recent interview with Raymond Bellour forms Part 2 of the book's three sections. Divided into six chapters, it covers the following topics: his formative influences; film analysis and the symbolic; Thierry Kuntzel and the rise of video art; arrested images and ``the between-images''; spectators,               dispositifs               , and the cinematic body; hypnosis, emotions and animality. Part 3 concludes the volume with a short biographical sketch and a select annotated bibliography of Bellour's most important publications.},

These flip screens rotated under computer control and were synchronized to the motion picture that was projected onto their surface via five synchronized motion picture projectors. Each flip screen contained three sides, with white projection surfaces on two sides and a matte black surface on the third. The combination of the film and the screens' rotation created undulating, sometimes three-dimensional-appearing images.}

  abstract = {The Politics of Aesthetics rethinks the relationship between art and politics, reclaiming 'aesthetics' from the narrow confines it is often reduced to. Jacques Ranci\`ere reveals its intrinsic link to politics by analysing what they both have in common: the delimitation of the visible and the invisible, the audible and the inaudible, the thinkable and the unthinkable, the possible and the impossible. Presented as a set of inter-linked interviews, The Politics of Aesthetics provides the most comprehensive introduction to Ranci\`ere's work to date, ranging across the history of art and politics from the Greek polis to the aesthetic revolution of the modern age. Available now in the Bloomsbury Classics series 10 years after its original publication, The Politics of Aesthetics includes an afterword by Slavoj \v{Z}i\v{z}ek, an interview for the English edition, a glossary of technical terms and an extensive bibliography.},

It brings new perspectives to bear on the work of established American pioneers such as Carolee Schneemann and Stan Vanderbeek as well as exploring expanded cinema in Western and Central Europe, the influence of video art on new media technologies, and the role of British expanded cinema from the 1970s to the present day.

  abstract = {This paper looks at the material and cultural visibility of Anthony McCall's 'solid light' films from the early 1970s. Their projectors centrally located on the ground of the black box, viewers physically interacted with the beams of light in these structural films to become part of the work. Where discussion has tended to emphasise the material presence of light and the dismantling of the cinematic apparatus in the solid light films, I investigate space as an essential delimiter and condition and contingency \textemdash{} both physically and socially \textemdash{} for their very visibility. In other words, how do these works, which are betwixt and between media (film, sculpture, and performance) and worlds (art and film), depend on space and place for recognition. I focus on the final work in the series, Long Film for Ambient Light, which, for its two-day duration (June 18 and 19, 1975), consisted of nothing but a light bulb, a time schema, and a manifesto installed within a slightly modified but appointed space, to question the ways it projects and rejects conventional models of time and subjectivity. I also look at McCall's digital copies of the solid light films as well as his recent 'vertical works' to ask how technology \textemdash{} both in production and display \textemdash{} alters meaning in ways material and metaphoric.},

While stereoscopy?s multiple optical illusions suggest that objects are within reach of our fingertips or that we are situated in 3D landscapes that stretch back to infinity, these embodied moments are fleeting, ephemeral and transitory. In each case, there is no longer a viewing body opposite, and at a distance from, the screen but constant reconfigurations of a shared screen space. Through particular attention to moments of negative parallax (wherein the content of the moving image appears to come towards the audience), this article addresses the implications that these points have for a fundamental ontology of the 3D film.},

I do this by analyzing how the f ilms' depictions of vast space are `sublime', while also considering how these sublime moments are made using computer-generated imagery. This sublime is potentially paradoxical in that the images are computer-generated (i.e. `fake'), while f ilm theorists have historically considered the awe inspired by cinema to depend upon the indexicality of the (analogue) image (i.e. cinematographic images depict something real, with that reality being separate from humans). However, drawing on Immanuel Kant's `mathematical sublime' and Gilles Deleuze's `powers of the false', I argue how these three films stage a sense not of sublime detachment but of sublime entanglement.},

Turning to the eye exercises and perspective games of the educator L\'aszl\'o Moholy-Nagy, the psychologist Adelbert Ames, Jr., and the artist Elad Lassry, it focuses on the human body as a site of instability in exposing the hidden potentialities of photographic space. The camera and the photograph are not used to replicate a pre-existing vision of reality but to explore the visual and cognitive terrain of a new spatial logic. By examining how bodies are organized within and by the picture, it argues that the synthetic topologies of photographic seeing can proprioceptively reorient viewers to the heightened ambiguities of the digital screen as photographic and computational space intersect.},

  abstract = {In this essay, I examine how the trope of navigation in 3D moving images can work towards an intimate and haptic encounter with other times and other places. The particular navigational construction of space in time in 3D moving images can be considered a cartography of time. This is a haptic cartography of exploration of the surfaces on which this encounter takes place. Taking Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams (2010) as a theoretical object, the main question addressed is how the creative exploration of new visualization technologies\textemdash from rock painting and principles of animation to 3D moving images\textemdash entails an epistemological inquiry into, and statements about, the power of images, technologies of vision, and the media cartographies they make.},

  abstract = {My work questions how material relations can appear on the surface of different media\textemdash on f ilm and video screens, in gallery installations, or on the skins of buildings and people. In response to these issues, I propose to approach materiality as a surface condition. Focusing on screen surface, I show that technologies of light can produce new forms of materiality. In this text, the screen emerges as a site of encounter and admixture. Various experiments of screening are considered, ranging from those envisaged by L\'aszl\'o Moholy-Nagy to the contemporary installations of Krzysztof Wodiczko. In these conf igurations of the act of screening, different forms of mediation, memory, and transformation can take place. This is what I call `the surface tension of media'.},

Critically deploying various notions of the haptic culled from film and media theory and perceptual psychology, S\ae ther discusses Trisha Baga's low-tech 3D video Flatlands (2010) and Victoria Fu's immersive video installation Belle Captive I (2012) and expounds a contemporary haptic space that verges between planarity and volume, between the near and far, and that exceeds the frame to enfold us. As S\ae ther argues, the salience of this motif points to the split between human sense perception and the networked, computational operations of 21st-century media, and the attempt to grasp this split.},

How closely did the trade press's representation of editing, as a formal system subject to change, align with trends apparent on the screen? Did commentators of the day register editing's changing functions? To what degree can we detect an ``editing consciousness'' within the trade press, and how did it operate in the crucial years of 1913-17? To better answer these questions, this essay looks at the terminology that writers employed when writing about editing during these years, the advisories that they issued, and the factors that may have influenced their conceptions of editing. These observations will help us define with more precision how the industry reconciled itself to editing's ascendancy and reaffirm the uneven contours of the process of institutionalization.},

Twenty-five years after his death, his canvases regularly exceed \textsterling 40million at auction. Bacon's appeal is rooted in his notoriety - a candid image he presented of himself as Roaring Boy, Lord of Misrule and Conveyor of Artistic Violence. This was true enough, but only part of the truth. He carefully cultivated the facade, protecting the complex and haunted man behind the myth. In this unique, compelling film, those who knew him speak freely, some for the first time, to reveal the many mysteries of Francis Bacon. Written by Tom Waist},

In this book, the author provides a comprehensive introduction to Bachelard's work, demonstrating how his writings on the literary imagination can be better understood in the context of his exploration of how knowledge works in science. After an overview of Bachelard's writings on the scientific mind as it was transformed by relativity, quantum physics, and modern chemistry, the author examines Bachelard's works on the imagination in light of particular intellectual values Bachelard derived from science. His trajectory from science to a specifically literary imagination is traced by recognizing his concern with what science teaches about how we know, and his increasing preoccupation with questions of being when dealing with poetic imagery. The author also explores the material and dynamic imagination associated with the four elements - fire, water, air, and earth - and the phenomenology of creative imagination in Bachelard's Poetics of Space, his Poetics of Reverie, and the fragments of Poetics of Fire.},

Wells's 'scientific romance' The Time Machine: An Invention, the first literary work in which movement through time is made possible by a technical device, and the first public presentation, on the evening of December 28, 1895, of the Lumi\`ere Brothers's Cin\'ematographe: a film camera functioning also as a film projector which, together with Edison's Kinetoscope and Kinetograph, introduced new possibilities of recording, storing, reproducing, and manipulating the visual flow of events unfolding in time. Based on this double starting point, Time Machine: Cinematic Temporalities tackles the way in which cinema and other moving-image media such as video and video installations have transformed, throughout their history, our perception of time through the different techniques of slow motion and acceleration, loops and reversals, time lapse and freeze-frame, multiple exposures, stop-motion animation, in addition to the endless variations of the operation of montage: that crucial act of separating and joining images and sounds which has often been considered as one of cinema's defining traits.

  abstract = {잊혀지고, 버려지고, 수집되었다가 다시 내팽개쳐지고, 온전치 못하더라도 사랑받았던 책들, 그렇게 기꺼이 우리에게 도달하려 하는 모든 책들에 바치는 헌사. 종이책 외에 다른 대안은 존재하지 않을 것만 같던 세상에서 태어나고 자라 이제 60대에 접어든 독일의 한 작가가 `종이책'을 둘러싼 아련한 기억들을 소환한다. 책과 책의 알맹이인 텍스트, 이 둘을 누릴 때 가장 행복하다고 느끼는 사람들, 어쩌면 결국 사라질지도 모르는 우리의 `책 문화'와 이를 둘러싼 `소박한 기억들'에 대한 이야기를 들려준다. 또 다른 한편으론 두꺼운 사전, 먼지 냄새 가득한 헌책방, 이동식 도서관 버스처럼 우리 곁에서 차츰 사라져가고 있는 것들에 아쉬움을 담아 보내는 작별의 인사이기도 하다. 한국어판에는 책 사랑으로 둘째가라면 서러울 우리나라의 대표 독서가인 서평가 이현우(로쟈), 유튜브 `겨울서점'의 김겨울이 자신만의 이야기를 덧붙여 의미를 더했다.},

  author = {Strutt, Dan},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {The media technologies that surround and suffuse our everyday life profoundly affect our relation to reality. Philosophers since Plato and Aristotle have sought to understand the complex influence of apparently simple tools of expression on our understanding and experience of the world, time, space, materiality and energy. The Digital Image and Reality takes up this crucial philosophical task for our digital era. This rich yet accessible work argues that when new visual technologies arrive to represent and simulate reality, they give rise to nothing less than a radically different sensual image of the world. Through engaging with post-cinematic content and the new digital formats in which it appears, Strutt uncovers and explores how digital image-making is integral to emergent modes of metaphysical reflection - to speculative futurism, optimistic nihilism, and ethical plasticity. Ultimately, he prompts the reader to ask whether the impact of digital image processes might go even beyond our subjective consciousness of reality, towards the synthesis of objective actuality itself. Bron: Flaptekst, uitgeversinformatie. The philosophy of technology suggests that rather than technologies being simply useful tools, they also have an often relatively unnoticed or subconscious impact upon the way we live our lives - our interactions with the world, and the way we think. Seen in this way, all media technologies might affect our metaphysical sense of time, space and force through their relative ability to represent these concepts. In 'The Digital Image and Reality', digital visual technologies are examined through their radically different capacities for representation and simulation and the challenges that they pose to our understanding of the world. I analyse how digital images are well suited to graphical imagination and speculation about the nature of material reality. What is suggested throughout the book is that digital visual technologies offer a new sensual image of the world, subtly impacting not simply our subjective perception or consciousness of reality, but perhaps objective actuality itself.},

Exploring key cases such as post-perspectival space, 3D, vertical framing, haptics, and layering, this volume takes stock of emerging forms of screen space and spatialities as they move from the margins to the centre of contemporary media practice. Recent years have seen a marked scholarly interest in spatial dimensions and conceptions of moving image culture, with some theorists claiming that a 'spatial turn' has taken place in media studies and screen practices alike. Yet this is the first book-length study dedicated to on-screen spatiality as such. Spanning mainstream cinema, experimental film, video art, mobile screens, and stadium entertainment, the volume includes contributions from such acclaimed authors as Giuliana Bruno and Tom Gunning as well as a younger generation of scholars.},

  abstract = {This book is a guide for writers aspiring to become more productive and take greater pleasure in their craft. Helen Sword interviewed one hundred academics worldwide about their writing background and practices. Relatively few were trained as writers, she found, and yet all have developed strategies to thrive in their publish-or-perish environment. Sword identifies four cornerstones that anchor any successful writing practice: Behavioral habits of discipline and persistence; Artisanal habits of craftsmanship and care; Social habits of collegiality and collaboration; and Emotional habits of positivity and pleasure. Building on this "BASE," she illuminates the emotional complexity of the writing process and exposes the lack of writing support typically available to early-career academics. She also lays to rest the myth that academics must produce safe, conventional prose or risk professional failure. The successful writers profiled here tell stories of intellectual passions indulged, disciplinary conventions subverted, and risk-taking rewarded. Grounded in empirical research and focused on sustainable change, Air \& Light \& Time \& Space offers a customizable blueprint for refreshing personal habits and creating a collegial environment where all writers can flourish.--},

The two philosophers' appeals to ontology, as an important site upon which their ethico-political commitments to critique and creativity simultaneously converge and diverge, frame this exploration. The first part of the essay shows how Deleuze's and Foucault's respective ontologies further critique and creativity. The second part of the essay focuses on a point of divergence in the two thinkers' appeals to ontology: the relationship between philosophy and history. From a Foucauldian perspective, the ahistorical character of Deleuze's ontology of difference threatens to undermine its transformative potential, whereas from a Deleuzian perspective, the historical character of Foucault's ontology of the present, while it may not undermine transformation, certainly does not facilitate it. In conclusion, I argue that it is precisely from within these tensions that important, productive, and transformative aspects of Deleuze's and Foucault's work emerge.},

Faced with this challenge, the essay makes a case for a new historiographical model, ``Media Archaeology,'' in order to overcome the opposition between ``old'' and ``new'' media, destabilized in today's media practice. The field of audio-visual experience needs to be re-mapped, clarifying what is meant by embodiment, interface, narrative, diegesis, and providing new impulses also for the study of non-entertainment uses of the audio-visual dispositif.},

  abstract = {This introductory article to the following ``cluster of articles'' proposes to apply the term ``signal'' as a theoretical and analytical category for a new approach to the bearings of electronic and new media in particular. As the term ``sign'' was formerly developed from linguistics, the term signal was developed from Norbert Wiener's writings on mathematics and cybernetics. The electronic signal is a technological fact dating back to the telegraph that in a substantial way set the agenda for contemporary (popular) culture (electronic music, youth, and performance culture) and further facilitated the digital code and the Internet. In this article, as well as in the following articles, the term signal is above all applied in its broader sense to explore possible signaletic modes and characteristics in contemporary art and new media culture. It is thus a key point that technological implications could never be causal to aesthetic variations and cultural modes. Departing from this, this article explores artistic and cultural manifestations from the 1960s and onward in the light of the signal in order to analytically grasp the changes or supplements to the sign that in a contemporary culture is bringing new forms of events and affects to the fore.},

Although it is sometimes referred to as another artistic medium. the computer plays a fundamentally different role in the activities of making and viewing art. A computer can output to many media, but its mode of operation is not the same as theirs. While an interface connects a computer to a medium, it also keeps it from becoming one of them. By studying the concepts of interface, interaction, and simulation, profound differences become apparent. A medium supplies physical material receptive to creative formation, while a computer offers conceptual agency cap, able of contentious discourse: it fu nctions more like a creative parmer than an expressive channel.},

  abstract = {The relevance of painting has been questioned many times over the last century, by the arrival of photography, installation art and digital technologies. But rather than accept the death of painting, Mark Titmarsh traces a paradoxical interface between this art form and its opposing forces to define a new practice known as `expanded painting' giving the term historical context, theoretical structure and an important place in contemporary practice. As the formal boundaries tumble, the being of painting expands to become a kind of total art incorporating all other media including sculpture, video and performance. Painting is considered from three different perspectives: ethnology, art theory and ontology. From an ethnological point of view, painting is one of any number of activities that takes place within a culture. In art theory terms, painting is understood to produce objects of interest for humanities disciplines. Yet painting as a medium often challenges both its object and image status, `expanding' and creating hybrid works between painting, objects, screen media and text. Ontologically, painting is understood as an object of aesthetic discourse that in turn reflects historical states of being. Thus, Expanded Painting delivers a new kind of saying, a post-aesthetic discourse that is attuned to an uncanny tension between the presence and absence of painting},

VanDerBeek was revolutionary in his thinking about the power of imagery and technology in his ambitious installations from the 1960s and 1970s. He was compelled to explore how the multitude of existing images surrounding contemporary humankind \textendash{} film, advertisements, artworks, photographs \textendash{} could be used to create a new universal visual language. His belief in the computer as an extension of the mind kept him pursuing technology as a means of expressing and engaging human consciousness. VanDerBeek was experimenting with projections of newsreels and his own films onto multiple screens as early as 1958. In the early 1960s, he made films of Happenings as well as of performances by Merce Cunningham and Carolee Schneemann. In 1965, he contributed a Movie Mural to Cunningham's Variations V, transforming the dance backdrop into a moving image; Movie Mural became the term used to describe his mobile, multi-screen environments made for viewers and performers alike.}

  abstract = {The postmodern years of plenty, pastiche, and parataxis are over. In fact, if we are to believe the many academics, critics, and pundits whose books and essays describe the decline and demise of the postmodern, they have been over for quite a while now. But if these commentators agree the postmodern condition has been abandoned, they appear less in accord as to what to make of the state it has been abandoned for. In this essay, we will outline the contours of this discourse by looking at recent developments in architecture, art, and film. We will call this discourse, oscillating between a modern enthusiasm and a postmodern irony, metamodernism. We argue that the metamodern is most clearly, yet not exclusively, expressed by the neoromantic turn of late associated with the architecture of Herzog \& de Meuron, the installations of Bas Jan Ader, the collages of David Thorpe, the paintings of Kaye Donachie, and the films of Michel Gondry.},

Cocteau, Bu\~nuel (who was his assistant), Hitchcock, Pasolini and Godard, and theoreticians Kracauer, Deleuze and Ranci\`ere are directly influenced by Epstein's pioneering film work, writings, and concepts. This book is the first in English to examine his oeuvre comprehensively. An avant-garde artist and an anti-elitist intellectual, Epstein wanted to craft moments of pure transformative cinema. Using familiar genres - melodramas and documentaries - he hoped to heal viewers of all classes and hasten social utopia. A lover of cinema as cognitive and sensorial technology, and a poet of the screen, he pushed cinematography - as photog\'enie - towards the experimental sublime, through daring close-ups, rhythmic montage, slow motion, even reverse motion},

It brings new perspectives to bear on the work of established American pioneers such as Carolee Schneemann and Stan Vanderbeek as well as exploring expanded cinema in Western and Central Europe, the influence of video art on new media technologies, and the role of British expanded cinema from the 1970s to the present day. It shows how artists challenged the conventions of spectatorship, the viewing space and the audience, to explore a new participatory and performative cinema beyond the single screen},

  abstract = {This book answers one of the most puzzling questions in contemporary art: how did performance artists of the '60s and '70s, famous for their opposition both to lasting art and the political establishment, become the foremost monument builders of the '80s, '90s and today? Not by selling out, nor by making self-undermining monuments. This book argues that the centrality of performance to monuments and indeed public art in general rests not on its ephemerality or anti-authoritarian rhetoric, but on its power to build interpersonal bonds both personal and social. Specifically, the survival of body art in photographs that cross time and space to meet new audiences makes it literally into a monument. The argument of the book spans art in Austria, the former Yugoslavia, and Germany: Valie Export, Peter Weibel and the Viennese Actionists (working in Austria and abroad), Marina Abramovic, Sanja Ivecovic and Braco Dimitrijevic (working in Yugoslavia and abroad), and Joseph Beuys and Jochen Gerz (working in Germany and abroad). These artists began by critiquing monumentality in authoritarian public space, and expanded the models developed on the streets of Vienna, Munich, Rome, Belgrade and Zagreb to participatory monuments that delegate political authority to the audience. Readers interested in contemporary art, politics, photography and performance will find in this book new facts and arguments for their interconnection},

Invaluable for students, arts professionals and other aspiring writers, the book first navigates readers through the key elements of style and content, from the aims and structure of a piece to its tone and language. Brimming with practical tips that range across the complete spectrum of art-writing, the second part of the book is organized around its specific forms, including academic essays; press releases and news articles; texts for auction and exhibition catalogues, gallery guides and wall labels; op-ed journalism and exhibition reviews; and writing for websites and blogs. In counselling the reader against common pitfalls such as jargon and poor structure, Gilda Williams points instead to the power of close looking and research, showing how to deploy language effectively; how to develop new ideas; and how to construct compelling texts. More than 30 illustrations throughout support closely analysed case studies of the best writing, in Source Texts by 64 authors, including Claire Bishop, Thomas Crow, T.J. Demos, Okwui Enwezor, Dave Hickey, John Kelsey, Chris Kraus, Rosalind Krauss, Stuart Morgan, Hito Steyerl, and Adam Szymczyk. Supplemented by a general bibliography, advice on the use and misuse of grammar, and tips on how to construct your own contemporary art library, How to Write About Contemporary Art is the essential handbook for all those interested in communicating about the art of today.--},

Drawing from literature in media studies and geography - and the work of Michel Foucault and Doreen Massey - it examines how geographical and historical material, social, and cultural conditions are embedded in the way in which contemporary (digital) cartographies are read, deployed, and engaged. This is explored through seventeen walking interviews in Hong Kong and Sydney, as potent discourses like cartographic reason continue to transform and weave through the world in ways that haunt mobile mapping and bring old conflicts into new media. In doing so, Mobile Mapping offers an interdisciplinary rethinking about how multiple translations of spatial knowledges between rational digital epistemologies and tacit ways of understanding space and experience might be conceptualized and researched.},

  abstract = {This book develops media archaeological approaches to theatre and intermediality. As an age-old art form, theatre has always embraced 'new' media. To create theatrical effects and optical illusions, theatre makers were ready to integrate state-of-the-art technics and technologies, and by doing so they playfully explored and popularized scientific knowledge on mechanics, optics and sound for live audiences. This book highlights this obvious but often overlooked relation between media developments and the history of intermedial theater. By considering the interplay between present intermedial performances and their archaeological traces, the authors assembled here revisit old and often forgotten media approaches and theatre technologies. This archaeology is understood less as the discovery of a forgotten past than as the establishment of an active relationship between past and present. Rather than treating archaeological remains as representative tokens of a fragmented past that need to be preserved, the authors stress the return of the past in the present, but in a different, performative guise.},

Deleuze's concept of the map bridges the gap between the analog and the digital, information and representation, virtual and actual, canvas and screen and is therefore best suited for the contemporary artistic landscape. Deleuze and the Map-Image explores cartography from philosophical and aesthetic perspectives and argues that the concept of the map is a critical touchstone for contemporary multidisciplinary art. This book is an overview of Deleuze's cartographic thought read through the theories of Sloterdijk, Heidegger, and Virilio and the art criticism of Laura U. Marks, Carolyn L. Kane, and Alexander Galloway, shaping it into a critical tool through which to view the works of cutting edge artists such as Janice Kerbel and Hajra Waheed, who work with digital and analog art. After all, Deleuze did write that a map can be conceived as a work of art, and so herein art is critiqued through cartographic strategies."--Bloomsbury Publishing},

This book is an overview of Deleuze's cartographic thought read through the theories of Sloterdijk, Heidegger, and Virilio and the art criticism of Laura U. Marks, Carolyn L. Kane, and Alexander Galloway, shaping it into a critical tool through which to view the works of cutting edge artists such as Janice Kerbel and Hajra Waheed, who work with digital and analog art. After all, Deleuze did write that a map can be conceived as a work of art, and so herein art is critiqued through cartographic strategies. --},

Think of a Pollock or a Kandinsky that moves, a film created by scratching directly onto the celluloid, or a mechanical apparatus that fractures light and bends time. These moving-image artworks, and the tools and techniques that make them, open up new conversations about the production, meaning, and significance of the moving image. Indeed, the power of cinema has long been rooted in its photographic representation of the world and its ability to marshal images in the service of fictional or documentary narratives. But removing the camera from a study of film reshapes our understanding of cinema's past and its possibilities. From painted film to kinetic art, and from psychedelic light shows to video synthesis, Gregory Zinman recovers the range of forms, tools, and intentions that make up cinema's shadow history, enlightening our awareness of the intersection of art and media in the twentieth century, and deepening our understanding and appreciation of what is to come"--Provided by publisher},

Her seminal book In the Age of the Smart Machine foresaw the consequences of a then-unfolding era of computer technology. Now, three decades later she asks why the once-celebrated miracle of digital is turning into a nightmare. Zuboff tackles the social, political, business, personal, and technological meaning of "surveillance capitalism" as an unprecedented new market form. It is not simply about tracking us and selling ads, it is the business model for an ominous new marketplace that aims at nothing less than predicting and modifying our everyday behavior--where we go, what we do, what we say, how we feel, who we're with. The consequences of surveillance capitalism for us as individuals and as a society vividly come to life in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism's pathbreaking analysis of power. The threat has shifted from a totalitarian "big brother" state to a universal global architecture of automatic sensors and smart capabilities: A "big other" that imposes a fundamentally new form of power and unprecedented concentrations of knowledge in private companies--free from democratic oversight and control"--},

  abstract = {Recently, a number of artists and theorists have been writing about the algorithmic, infrastructural and economic aspects of the contemporary media world. Such writing shifts the conversation about social media away from considerations of novel discourse and instead places emphasis on the power structures, profit motives and political machinations that undergird networked reality. Social media platforms are designed to feel like autonomous arenas of free signification, rather than highly controlled and tightly monitored corporate/governmental spaces. In other words, these platforms make the Internet feel like it is built on discourse, rather than on code, servers, fibre-optic cables and the hyper-exploited labour involved in the mining of rare metals. This article examines writings by Hito Steyerl, Trevor Paglen, Jackie Wang and others to argue that artist-writers are using open-ended and flexible metaphors, along with other literary techniques, to articulate the connections between the largely invisible systems of code, surveillance and economics.},

  abstract = {Gaston Bachelard (1884\textendash 1962) occupies a unique position in the history of European thinking. As a philosopher of science, he developed a profound interest in genres of the imagination, notably poetry and novels. While emphatically acknowledging the strength, precision and reliability of scientific knowledge compared to every-day experience, he saw literary phantasies as important supplementary sources of insight. Although he significantly influenced authors such as Lacan, Althusser, Foucault and others, while some of his key concepts (``epistemological rupture,'' ``epistemological obstacle,'' ``technoscience'') are still widely used, his oeuvre tends to be overlooked. And yet, as I will argue, Bachelard's extended series of books opens up an intriguing perspective on contemporary science. First, I will point to a remarkable duality that runs through Bachelard's oeuvre. His philosophy of science consists of two suboeuvres: a psychoanalysis of technoscience, complemented by a poetics of elementary imagination. I will point out how these two branches deal with complementary themes: technoscientific artefacts and literary fictions, two realms of human experience separated by an epistemological rupture. Whereas Bachelard's work initially entails a panegyric in praise of scientific practice, he becomes increasingly intrigued by the imaginary and its basic images (``archetypes''), such as the Mother Earth archetype.},
